<b>For students and managers:</b> The Lighthouse suite shows how responsive parties can get sensible contracts signed sooner; manage challenges; and guard against gamesmanship. With extensive field notes and case citations.
</p>

<p>
<b>For lawyers:</b> Use the Lighthouse suite and its commentary as a desk reference when reviewing others' contract drafts. <b>Better still:</b> Save time and money — and escape the legal-review hamster wheel — by choosing from the "menu" of  Lighthouse protocols to adopt in a <i>binding</i> term sheet. <i>(Especially useful for short-form contracts in smaller matters.)</i>

<p>
This book aims to serve readers in several categories:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you're a <b>law student</b>:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You likely want to get a sense for how business deals are actually done in the real world &#x2014; especially deals for smaller clients, whom you might represent sooner than later in your legal career.</li>

<li>You also want to know how, as a new lawyer, you can draft contract language that will pass muster with your supervising attorney and not someday result in a [hacked]-off client and/or malpractice carrier.</li>

<li>You might well wonder whether artificial-intelligence will ruin your chances of getting decent training after graduation because AIs are taking over more of the routine work of law-firm junior associates in drafting contracts and reviewing other parties' drafts.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>If you're a <b>lawyer</b>, you probably value curated issue checklists and language sources.</li>

<li>If you're a lawyer's <b>client</b>, chances are that sometimes you have to read, understand, and actually carry out contracts.</li>

<li>In a contract dispute, <b>all concerned</b> will want to quickly and accurately grasp what the parties agreed to, including:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the parties' managers and even senior executives;</li>
<li>their litigation counsel;</li>
<li>judges and their law clerks, reading the contract "cold"; and</li>
<li>jurors (albeit rarely).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
In writing the Lighthouse protocols and elsewhere in this book, I've tried to keep in mind:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What <b>tasks</b> will these different readers be taking on?</li>

<li>For each of those tasks: How can this book help the reader <b>get the work done</b> faster &#x2014; better &#x2014; cheaper?  <cite> Business folk might recognize this perspective as an offshoot of <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-design-thinking">design thinking</a>, reflected in Clayton Christiansen's question: <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">What job is your customer buying your product for?</a> </cite></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-clt-goals" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="clt-goals"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Client goals for contracts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-clt-goals">
<p>
Most business people would agree that they usually care about:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>getting contracts signed as quickly as possible, because the people involved have lots else to do;</li>

<li>guarding against unscrupulous behavior by The Other Side;</li>

<li>planning for a reasonable set of what-if contingencies; and</li>

<li>building resilient commercial relationships.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And when possible, businesses prefer dealing with counterparties —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>who're agreeable to work with; and</li>

<li>who, when challenges arise, take reasonable positions and seek amicable solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, <i>customers</i> want to do business with vendors who have proved their reliability as suppliers of goods and services — especially when things get tough, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant supply-chain disruptions.<sup><a id="fnr.CustVendPref" class="footref" href="#fn.CustVendPref" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
And <i>vendors</i> prefer dealing with customers who pay on time and who provide repeat business and favorable referrals.
</p>

<p>
In that vein: The global not-for-profit trade association WorldCC has as one of its <a href="https://www.worldcc.com/About/Our-Strategy#Importance">stated purposes</a> "&#x2026; to transform contracts and the contracting process, such that they become instruments of fair dealing, that they themselves, and the process surrounding them, promote trust, [and] generate economic benefit &#x2026;."  <cite> <a href="https://www.worldcc.com/About">World Commerce & Contracting</a> (formerly the International Association for Contract and Commercial Management) has some 80,000 members representing more than 20,000 companies across 180 countries. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, some lawyers forget that in day-to-day contract negotiations, what clients want is <i>not</i> to prevail on as many points as possible, but instead:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to get an "OK" contract signed as quickly as possible, so they can get on with the rest of their to-do list — this is true whether you're representing a vendor or a customer;</li>

<li>to try to minimize the legal spend; <b>and</b></li>

<li>to have a good experience with the other company and its people —  building mutual trust as reliable business partners who could work together again and who might have each other's backs in a crunch. (See also the discussion of trust at <a href="#nl-trust-top">28.42</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Especially for business clients, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">the perfect is the enemy of the good</a>. That can sometimes be jarring to lawyers, because  we're professionally socialized to focus above all on our ethical duty of "zealous advocacy" for the client's position.  We sometimes misinterpreted that duty as attempting to put the client in the absolute best possible <i>litigation</i> position, for every conceivable situation — no matter how much the attempt might delay getting the deal done and possibly leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth. 
</p>

<p>
(On that last point, see possibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230301101359/https://dilbert.com/strip/2008-08-28">the greatest lawyer cartoon of all time</a>.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Students:</b> The <b>W.I.D.A.C. Rule</b> applies here: <i>When in doubt, ask the client</i>. 
</p>

<p>
The Lighthouse protocols aim to support these goals

<h4 id="nl-bal-terms"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.1.</span> The typical negotiation approach: Ask for the moon</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-bal-terms">
<p>
As a young lawyer in a big law firm, I somehow picked up the notion that, when drafting any contract:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You load up your draft with a wish list of things that your clients would love to get — or that could someday give your client leverage over the other side — with an eye to planning for every worst-case scenario you can think of.</li>
<li>You send your draft to the other side — which sends it back to you, marked up with <i>their</i> wish list.</li>
<li>in all likelihood, you and the other party go back and forth, exchanging multiple drafts and possibly doing one or more conference calls.</li>
<li>Finally, you compromise <i>somewhere</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For both parties, the overall mindset there is: <i>If you lead off by asking for the moon, in the end you'll get more of what you wanted</i>. This can be seen in advice from the late negotiation guru <a href="https://wikitia.com/wiki/Chester_Karrass">Chester L. Karrass</a>, whose unsmiling visage could be seen in airline-magazines ads for his training courses. Dr. Karrass's namesake organization still <a href="https://www.karrass.com/blog/anchoring-in-negotiation">urges parties</a> to anchor their negotiations by aiming high with "a [b]old [f]irst [o]ffer" and then bargaining down from there. And of course in much the same vein is Donald Trump's 1987 best-seller <i>The Art of the Deal</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-nl-moon-time" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="nl-moon-time"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.2.</span> <i>Always</i> asking for the moon is a time waster</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-moon-time">
<p>
Where everyday contracts re concerned, business people can get impatient with the always-ask-for-the-moon approach. That was driven home to me almost as soon as <a href="#bio">I joined BindView Corporation</a> as the newly-public company's first in-house lawyer. Suddenly I was handling all of the routine negotiations with customers about our standard contract form. <cite> BindView had been a long-time client; I'd helped the founder to start the company and joined full-time after its initial public offering. </cite>
</p>

<p>
It didn't take long to notice that, whenever we negotiated our standard contract with a customer, we usually ended up conceding the same points, over and over — like hamsters running in a wheel. That process turned out to be a big time drain — not just for me, but also for our sales people, because they'd commonly sit in on some of my legal-negotiation calls with their customers to keep an eye on things.  
</p>

<p>
Our sales people had better things to do than to babysit their deals' legal negotiations, of course: Especially as the end-of-quarter accounting cutoff date drew near, they'd have much preferred to be working on closing more deals with other customers (and earning more commissions).
</p>

<p>
As the saying goes: If I had a nickel for every time a sales person or senior exec had asked me: <i>Can't we just use a short contract that's reasonable for both sides, and be done with it?</i> &#x2026;
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-bv-rev" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="bv-rev"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.3.</span> Another way: The contract as "product offering"</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-bv-rev">
<p>
At some point the realization dawned: Every time we sent BindView's standard contract to a customer, it's as though we were trying to 'sell' the other party not just on our software but on our contract,  because our contract was indeed a tag-along product offering that was bundled with our software.
</p>

<p>
And for <i>any</i> product offering: When customers offer feedback, a smart provider will consider whether to modify the product to improve demand and customer satisfaction. 
</p>

<p>
So to try to break free of the negotiation hamster wheel, BindView's C-suite management agreed to try something different:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Over several months, whenever we negotiated workable changes in our contract, we made similar changes to our standard contract as well (with approval from the business execs, of course).</li>

<li>This resulted in improving our contract 'product' so that, right out of the box, it gave customers pretty much what they wanted. It did so in ways that we knew that we could support operationally (and, in my judgment, didn't significantly increase the company's legal exposure).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Eventually, I told our sales people that I wouldn't even look at <i>a customer's</i> contract form until the sales team got me a five-minute phone call with the customer's contract people. I said that, just as it was their job to sell the customer on buying our software, it was <i>my</i> job to try to sell the customer on using our contract.
</p>

<p>
(That alone helped speed up our sales cycle: Sometimes we ended up having to use the customer's contract after all. But that first call with the contract people gave each side a sense of who they were dealing with; this helped all of us assess what terms could be agreed to.) 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-bv-mov-rev" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="bv-mov-rev"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.4.</span> 'User reviews' of the BindView contract &#x2026; from customers' <i>lawyers</i></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-bv-mov-rev">
<p>
A side benefit of BindView's new approach was that our (re)balanced contract form helped sell our software: Customers' <i>lawyers</i> began to say how much they liked our contract; this helped to validate those customers' decision to do business with us.
</p>

<p>
I started making notes of the lawyers’ favorable comments. I quoted some of the comments (anonymously) on a cover page of our contract form.  Here are just a few of those comments, which <a href="https://www.oncontracts.com/balanced-contract-forms/">I posted online</a> some years ago; all are from conference calls:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>From an in-house attorney for a multinational health care company: "<i>I told our business people that if your software is as good as your contract, we’re getting a great product.</i>" (!)</li>

<li>From an in-house lawyer at a U.S. hospital chain: "<i>I giggled when I saw the 'movie reviews' on your cover sheet. I’d never seen that before: customers saying this was the greatest contract they’d ever seen. But the comments turned out to be true.</i>"</li>

<li>From a contract specialist at a national wireless-service provider: "<i>I told my boss I want to give your contract to all of our software vendors and tell them it’s our standard contract, but I know we can’t do that.</i>" (!)</li>

<li>From an in-house attorney at a global media company: "<i>This is a great contract. Most contracts might as well be written in Greek, but our business guys thought this one was very readable.</i>"</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-bv-std-o" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="bv-std-o"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.5.</span> A sales force standing ovation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-bv-std-o">
<p>
A few months after we'd had begun this transition to a customer-friendly contract form,  BindView acquired a smaller software company by the name of <a href="https://www.boulderventures.com/entevo">Entevo</a>.  After we closed the acquisition, our sales organization brought Entevo's sales people to Houston for onboarding, including training in how to sell <i>our</i> software. 
</p>

<p>
While the Entevo sales folks were in town, our VP of worldwide sales, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-pulaski-a7722/">David Pulaski</a> <i>(who said I could use his name in telling this story)</i> stuck his head in my office. David said he'd told our new sales reps that, unlike at Entevo, at BindView we did most of our deals on just a one-page sales quotation and our clickwrap license agreement, which was customer-friendly just like our negotiable contract form.  
</p>

<p>
David said that our new sales reps had given him a standing ovation. They told David that at Entevo, they'd had to use a detailed contract form that had lots of vendor-protective legalese. Not surprisingly, Entevo's customers had often insisted on negotiating the contract's legal terms and conditions, which the CFO handled. (Entevo didn't have an in-house lawyer.) That had sometimes slowed up Entevo's getting deals signed, causing some grumbling among Entevo's sales people.
</p>

<p>
So when David told the our new reps about BindView's approach, the reps instantly recognized that their work had just gotten easier: For most BindView sales oppotunities, our new reps could just quote a price; reference our clear, fair set of terms; and get the deal signed — helping the reps to make their quotas and earn commissions and <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/elements-of-sales-incentive-trip-program/">club trips</a> for themselves .
</p>

<p>
David's story has stuck with me, helping inspire the framing of this book: Fair, readable agreements help to cut deal friction — especially for smaller-dollar transactions.

<div id="outline-container-bv-rlf" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="bv-rlf"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.6.</span> But was BindView's contract 'safe'?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-bv-rlf">
<p>
You might wonder whether BindView ever experienced legal- or business problems from having a balanced, customer-friendly contract form. I’ll note only that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With the CEO’s permission, I talked about our contract philosophy in continuing-legal-education (a.k.a. CLE) seminars, and even included a copy of our standard form in written seminar materials;</li>

<li>We basically-never had any kind of contract-related problem with a customer when we'd used our contract form; and</li>

<li>In due course we had a successful 'exit': Having navigated through the software industry's 'nuclear winter' after the dot-com crash, we were approched and acquired by Symantec Corporation, one of the world’s largest software companies and the global leader in our field.</li>

<h4 id="org990e0bb"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.7.</span> The key: Role-flippable terms</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-7">
<p>
A useful way to write sellable contracts is to put yourself in the shoes of The Other Side. Let's (provisionally) assume that a contract clause is serviceably balanced if it provides <i>role-swappable terms</i>: We could define that expression as terms that <i>A</i> wouldn't be averse to agreeing to if <i>A</i> were to find itself in <i>B</i>'s shoes (or vice versa, obviously), in the manner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_Places">Freaky Friday</a> movies.
</p>

<p>
(Or for readers of a certain age: Role-swappable contract terms put the parties in a similar position as the characters played by <i>SNL</i> alumni Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy in the 1983 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_Places">Trading Places</a>;  coincidentally, <i>Trading Places</i> also featured Jamie Lee Curtis, who later starred in both of the <i>Freaky Friday</i> movies as well.)
</p>


<p>
This approach is akin to the ancient "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_choose">divide and choose</a>" procedure. That's sometimes known as "you cut, I choose," by which children can evenly divide a cookie between them. A similar approach is often used in so-called "shotgun" <a href="#nl-shotgun">buy-sell agreements</a> and in last-offer arbitration; see Protocol <a href="#r-escal-ext">2.6</a> for a variation. <cite> All these approaches are grounded in the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1910125116">Rawlsian veil of ignorance</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Here's another potential benefit: On two different occasions, having a Freaky-Friday contract helped BindView get deals done almost immediately when we were the customer, not the vendor:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On those two occasions, BindView was licensing another vendor's software for our internal use.</li>

<li>The other vendor wanted to use its own software license agreement, of course. But that license agreement had problems.  It would have taken considerable revision and, presumably, legal negotiation for it to work for us as the customer.</li>

<li>So, we proposed to the vendor that instead we should just use <i>BindView's</i> standard software license agreement — but with BindView as the customer instead of as the vendor. We said we'd be happy to live with the same terms that we asked our customers to accept.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each time, the other vendor reviewed our license agreement and quickly agreed to our trading-places proposal.
</p>

<p>
So in this book, we'll use role-swappable terms as our reference benchmarks — as neutral "rules of the road" that contracting parties can agree that they'll follow.  We do this on the premise that, when clients negotiate an everyday contract, what they usually want is:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to get a workable deal done (preferably using a <i>readable</i> contract), with a reliable business partner that has incentives to behave reasonably;</li>
<li>at a reasonable legal cost and on a reasonable timeline — but sooner is always better;</li>
<li>at an acceptable level of business risk, with protections appropriate to that risk, without trying to cover every. possible. contingency;</li>
<li>without trying to play games or big-foot The Other Side;</li>
<li>while signaling their own reliability as prospective business partners; and</li>
<li>building trust, not traps.</li>
</ul>

<p>
(All this can run somewhat counter to typical law-school training: We lawyers learn to adopt something of a worst-case, adversarial mindset — and we're often inclined to draft contracts accordingly.)

<h4 id="trump-switch"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.8.</span> Counterexample: A Trump building lease backfires</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-trump-switch">
<p>
<i>(I wrote this particular section a few months before Donald Trump descended a golden escalator to announce his 2016 presidential campaign.)</i>
</p>

<p>
The Trump Corporation ("Trump") has been a real-estate landlord, among other things. According to AmLaw Daily, years ago Trump's lawyers took one of the company's leases, changed the names, and used it for a deal in which Trump was the <i>tenant</i> and not the landlord. Later, though, Trump-as-tenant found that its lease-agreement form gave Trump's <i>landlord</i> significant leverage: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"The funny part of it is what one of his internal lawyers must have done years ago," <i>[the landlord's president]</i> says. "Normally Trump is the landlord, not the tenant. So what they did is they took one of their leases and just changed the names. And so it's not a very favorable lease if you're the tenant." <cite>  Nate Raymond, <i>Trump Misses Rent Payments &#x2026;,</i> <a href="http://goo.gl/B72TIr">http://goo.gl/B72TIr</a> (AmLawDaily.Typepad.com) (accessed Apr. 27, 2015 but no longer online, not even at archive.org — the site host, Typepad, ceased operations). </cite>

<p>
<b>Lesson:</b> Contract drafters will often do well to heed advice similar to that of the song <a href="https://youtu.be/It2oo2ZT6FI?si=tHrf1e926f5X-LcK&t=92">Coplas</a> on the Kingston Trio's 1958 debut album, where the in-song patter "<a href="https://compvid101.blogspot.com/2012/08/coplascanastas-y-mas-canastas.html">translated</a>" the Spanish lyrics into English: <i>Tell your parents not to muddy the water around us: They may have to drink it soon &#x2026;.</i>

<div id="outline-container-nda-fail-safe" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="nda-fail-safe"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.9.</span> Role-swappable terms can be safer for all</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nda-fail-safe">
<p>
Role-swappable contract terms can also pay off if the parties' roles ever do get reversed and the business people think that it's safe to use the same contract.
</p>

<p>
Here's one typical example: In many cases, a <i>two-way</i> confidentiality agreement ("NDA") that protects each party's confidential information is likely to be signed sooner, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>each negotiator presumably keeps in mind that <i>today's</i> disclosing party might be <i>tomorrow's</i> receiving party or vice versa; and so:</li>

<li>the two-way agreement is thus <i>likely</i> — but not guaranteed, see <a href="#two-way-bias">1.4.10</a> — to be more balanced;</li>

<li>moreover, if the parties were ever to switch roles — with the parties agreeing that the original recipient should disclose its own information to the original discloser — then a two-way agreement can avoid (what the original recipient would regard as) disaster, as discussed at <a href="#conf-info-pty">11.3.34.3</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In contrast: With a <i>one-way</i> nondisclosure agreement, only the originally-intended discloser's information is protected. This means that any disclosures <i>by the original recipient</i> might be completely unprotected — resulting in the receiving party's losing its trade-secret rights in its information.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: That's pretty close to what happened to one trade-secret owner: The owner had signed a confidentiality agreement with another party,  but that agreement protected only the other party's information. Consequently, said the court, the owner's disclosure of its <i>own</i> confidential information was unprotected.  <cite> See <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3855750888701636738">Fail-Safe, LLC v. A.O. Smith Corp.</a> 674 F.3d 889, 893-94 (7th Cir. 2012) (affirming summary judgment for other party). </cite>
</p>

<p>
It's not hard to imagine the thought process that the owner's business people's went through: "We need to disclose <i>our</i> information to <i>you</i>. We've already got an NDA in place. So sure, let's do it." But the NDA didn't do what the plaintiff needed.
</p>

<p>

<h4 id="two-way-bias"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.10.</span> Caution: Role-swappable — but still biased?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-two-way-bias">
<p>
Any agreement that's <i>nominally</i> two-way could still be biased in favor of the drafting party. 
</p>

<p>
Example: Suppose that Fred's drafter knows that Fred will be <i>receiving</i> Ginger's confidential information, but Fred won't be <i>disclosing</i> his own confidential information. In that situation:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Representing Fred <i>as Recipient</i>, Fred's drafter might write a "two-way" (quote unquote) confidentiality provision that provides very little protection for <i>anyone's</i> confidential information, because that lack of protection won't hurt Fred as Recipient — <i>at least not in the short term</i>.</li>

<li>Ginger, as Discloser, would therefore have to review the confidentiality provisions carefully to make sure it contained sufficient protection for her Confidential Information.</li>

<li>Conversely, if <i>Ginger's</i> drafter is doing the drafting — knowing that Ginger will be <i>disclosing her</i> information to Fred, but she won't be <i>receiving Fred's</i> information — then Ginger's drafter might craft the confidentiality provision with burdensome requirements that Fred would have to review carefully.</li>

<h3 id="cls-format"><span class="section-number-3">1.5.</span> Theme: More-conversational language</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-cls-format">
<p>
Many Lighthouse provisions aim for quicker comprehension — and a friendlier feel — by using less-formal language, such as —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the use of <i>will</i> instead of <i>shall</i> (or <i>will not</i> instead of <i>shall not</i>) to indicate a party's obligation, as spelled out at Protocol <a href="#r-will-defn">3.13.6</a>;</li>

<li>the use of contractions (such as <i>don't</i> instead of <i>do not</i>), which is slowly catching on in legal writing to make it more- accessible and reader-friendly.<sup><a id="fnr.ContractionsSCT" class="footref" href="#fn.ContractionsSCT" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>
This follows the example of "a more modern, conversational writing style <i>[used]</i> by all nine <i>[Supreme Court]</i> justices."  <cite> <a href="https://studyfinds.org/supreme-court-liberal-writing-style/">The Supreme Court is becoming far more liberal − in its writing style</a> (StudyFinds.org 2025) (archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250126100621/https://studyfinds.org/supreme-court-liberal-writing-style/">here</a> and <a href="https://perma.cc/4SS8-9TKN">here</a>). </cite>
</p>

<p>
But, you ask: If a contract provision isn't written with traditional formality, will it still be binding? <b>Yes</b> — think of the various "terms of service" agreements you've been asked to sign, often electronically.<sup><a id="fnr.MailChimp" class="footref" href="#fn.MailChimp" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>

<p>
As a lawyer, I "came up" at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howrey">Arnold, White & Durkee</a>, a 150-lawyer intellectual property litigation firm, where I was an associate and then a partner, and was eventually elected to the management committee. We were one of the largest such firms in the United States, with offices in six different cities with significant tech industries.
</p>

<p>
I left AW&D during the dot-com boom to become vice president and general counsel of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BindView">BindView Corporation</a>, a publicly-traded, 500-employee software company, with offices in six countries. As outside counsel, I’d helped the founders start the company and joined them full-time not long after the company went public. I served there — negotiating probably hundreds of contracts — until our "exit," when we were <a href="https://www.scworld.com/news/symantec-snaps-up-bindview">acquired by Symantec Corporation</a>, the world leader in our field.
</p>

<p>
Since leaving BindView I've maintained a limited solo practice helping tech companies, both established and startups. In addition, since 2010 I've taught a <a href="https://toedtclassnotes.site44.com/Syllabus.html">contract-drafting course at UH</a> — for which this book serves as the main reading — and since 2021, an annual <a href="https://courses.rice.edu/courses/courses/!SWKSCAT.cat?p_action=COURSE&p_term=202620&p_crn=25377">IP-introduction course</a> for Rice University MBA students.

<li>Such an adoption could happen:

<li>in some other reasonable manner.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Here, the term "<b>Lighthouse provision</b>" refers to the following:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"the Lighthouse suite" or simply "the Lighthouse," in either case without being more specific (which has the effect stated in § <a href="#gen-prov-proto-all">2.1.2</a> below); or</li>

<p>
When the Con&shy;tract adopts "the Lighthouse suite" or simply "the Lighthouse," without being more specific, they are agreeing to follow each of the Lighthouse provisions listed in this General Provisions Package, plus any others that are specifically mentioned in the Con&shy;tract, but none apart from that.

A.&nbsp; In an amendment's title, strongly consider including a <b>series number</b> and <b>date</b> — and perhaps even include a (brief) mention of the amendment's <b>purpose</b> — to leave a paper trail, reduce the chances of confusion, and make it easier for a reader to find the amendment when skimming a list of document titles.

<b>This is especially important to consider when multiple amendments have occurred.</b> EXAMPLE: The members of a limited-liability company ("LLC") agreed to amend the LLC's operating agreement when its managing member resigned — that amendment was the <i>ninth</i> one. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8126733645927116877">Paul v. Rockport Group, LLC</a>, No. 2018-0907-JTL (Del. Ch. Jan. 9, 2024) (granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff, the LLC's former managing member). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> If you'll be making extensive changes to a contract — or if there have already been multiple amendments to the same contract over time — then consider doing a complete "<b>amended and restated</b>" agreement, with that title, to replace the earlier agreement. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The title of one <a href="https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/media-library/epd/c6e56864-3f30-49b1-9c47-51e98b95fd96.pdf">Enterprise Products Partners limited-partnership agreement</a> is, "<i>Seventh Amended and Restated</i> Agreement of Limited Partnership of Enterprise Products Partners L.P." (emphasis added).
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> If doing an amended-and-restated agreement, you'll want to consider whether you could be wiping out a provision that your client might later want to rely on. EXAMPLE: That was the result in a case where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A 2014 contract between an electronic-payments processor and a small company contained a payment guaranty that was signed by the company's owner.</li>
<li>But an <i>amended and restated</i> 2019 contract wasn't guaranteed by the owner (but by a different person).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The small company didn't pay the payment processor, so the payment processor sued the company owner for payment. Because the owner didn't guarantee payments under the 2019 contract, the trial court dismissed that part of the payment processor's case for failure to state a claim — that is, the court concluded that legally the payment processor didn't have a case against the company owner for unpaid amounts under the 2019 contract. On that issue, an appeals court affirmed (although it sent the case back to the trial court to reconsider whether the company owner could still be liable for amounts incurred under the 2014 contract). <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16771428193759203170">Electronic Merchant Systems v. Gaal</a>, 58 F.4th 877 (6th Cir. 2023). </cite>

<b>Q: Which party or parties sign an amendment?</b>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A valid amendment to the Con&shy;tract is signed by: <br/><span class="bboxy">&#x2611;</span>  at least the party that is to be bound by the amendment. <br/><span class="bboxn">&#x2610;</span> all parties to the Con&shy;tract. <aside> Certainly it's better if all parties sign an amendment document.

<p>
B.&nbsp; Here's a potential <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>: If a contract <i>states</i> that amendments must be signed by <i>all</i> parties, then a missing signature could render the entire amendment unenforceable, even if the omission was inadvertent.

<li>EXAMPLE: JPMorgan Chase lent money to a borrower. The loan agreement specifically said that both parties were required to sign any modification. The borrower claimed that the loan agreement had been modified — but the court said that the modification was ineffective because JPMorgan Chase never did countersign it. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2438804884742026716">Taylor v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-amend-vs-waiver">
<p>
Parties considering an "amendment" to the Con&shy;tract should consider whether what they really want is simply one party's <b>waiver</b> (see Protocol <a href="#r-waiv-defn">3.11</a>) of a particular right or obligation. 
</p>

<p>
According to Black's Law Dictionary (the canonical English-language legal dictionary), an <i>amendment</i> is "[a] formal and usu. <i>[usually]</i> minor revision or addition proposed or made to a statute, constitution, pleading, order, or other instrument &#x2026;."
</p>

<p>
Here's a hypothetical example: Imagine a contract between Alice and Bob. Suppose that the contract calls for Bob to take care of Alice's lawn; Bob's obligations include mowing the lawn each week, raking leaves in the autumn, etc.
</p>

<p>
Now suppose that on one particular day, Alice comes outside to talk to Bob when she arrives to mow the lawn. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If Alice says, "Hi Bob — I don't need the lawn mowed this week." That's known as a <b>waiver</b>, by Alice, of Bob's obligation for that occasion.</li>

<li>Or, Alice might say, "never mind, Bob, I don't need you to mow the lawn <i>ever</i>, because my teen-aged son wants to do it from now on — so let's talk about changing the contract to reduce what you have to do <b>and also</b> reduce what I pay you." If Bob agrees, that's known as an <b>amendment</b> of their contract.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-amend-release">
<p>
Sometimes a contract will be amended to resolve a disagreement between the parties. If that happens, a release might be drafted so broadly as to cause other rights to vanish.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a federal-government contracting case, fact issues precluded summary judgment whether a contract modification had effected a release of certain other claims, so that the contractor would be barred from asserting those other claims against the government.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-amend-side">
<p>
Drafters of amendments should watch out for possible unwanted "side effects," in which an amendment to one provision turns out to affect one or more other provisions as well.  This can be a particular problem when defined terms are used, as discussed in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-kidd-99a46956/?originalSubdomain=uk">Kidd</a> (stephens-bolton.com, undated).
</p>

<p>
This, incidentally, is one reason for contract drafters to follow the D.R.Y. Principle (see at <a href="#dont-repeat">32.9</a>) — that is, Don't Repeat Yourself, usually — to try to reduce such intra-draft "dependencies," and thus the possibility for inconsistent revisions to the draft during negotiations.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-amend-filing">
<p>
In ongoing business relationships, contracts might be amended multiple times. At some point in the future, it might be easy to overlook a previously-signed amendment — and then be caught by surprise in a future discussion (friendly or otherwise). 
</p>

<p>
For that reason, parties should save <b>any</b> signed amendment document in a place where it will be noticed by later readers of the contract. (This <i>should</i> be a routine thing for businesses already.)

<p>
Technically, a binding written document amending the Con&shy;tract could be an exchange of emails — or even an exchange of text messages. EXAMPLE: In a lawsuit between a digital ad agency and one of its clients, an e-cigarette manufacturer, an IM exchange resulted in the manufacturer's having to pay the agency more than $1 million in additional fees:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The crux of the IM exchange started with a message from an account executive at the ad agency: "We can do 2000 [ad placement] orders/day by Friday if I have your blessing."</li>

<li>The e-cigarette manufacturer's VP of advertising responded: "NO LIMIT"</li>

<li>The ad agency's account executive responded: "awesome!"</li>
</ul>

<p>
That series of messages served to modify the parties' contract; as a result, the e-cigarette manufacturer had to pay the ad agency the additional fees. <cite> See <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-flsd-0_09-cv-62020/pdf/USCOURTS-flsd-0_09-cv-62020-0.pdf">CX Digital Media, Inc. v.

(3) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this Article (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-201">Section 2-201</a>) <i>[which requires certain contracts to be in writing]</i> must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.

(5) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion <i>[i.e., a not-yet-started portion]</i> of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.

<p>
<b>Q: How often do catch-up calls happen?</b> 
</p>

<p>
Each party participates in a catch-up call as stated in this Protocol whenever any party <a href="#rsnbl-top">reasonably</a> asks — for example, to deal with problems and/or &#x2011;opportunities, whether existing or anticipated. <aside> To help keep transactions, projects, and relationships on course, parties could schedule catch-up calls at convenient intervals — e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly. </aside>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org4e78376">
<p>
A.&nbsp; The "whenever any party reasonably asks" limitation would automatically impose a natural limit:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In a one-off transaction, there might never be reasonable grounds to invoke this Protocol.</li>
<li>In an ongoing relationship, this Protocol provides a built-in channel for structured communication.</li>
</ul>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Regular communication can be one of <i>the</i> best ways of keeping business dealings on track, as discussed at <a href="#nl-comms">2.3.7</a>. For that reason, parties should consider discussing whether to <i>schedule</i> regular catch-up calls.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Catch-up calls will be by video conference unless all parties agree to some other way (phone call, etc.). <aside> Video conferencing lets the parties screen-share for "whiteboarding" (which reportedly is a key business practice at AI chipmaker Nvidia). <cite> See, e.g., Amanda Liang and Willis Ke, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241212PD205/nvidia-jensen-huang-management-ceo.html">Jensen Huang breaks bureaucracy at Nvidia with whiteboard and flat management strategies</a> (Digitimes.com 2024). </cite> </aside></li>

<li>The party that asks for a catch-up call chooses the video-conferencing platform (which must be reasonably available to the other party or &#x2011;parties). <aside> When it comes to choosing a video-conferencing platform — e.g., Zoom, Teams, etc. — presumably the parties will be able to agree on <i>that</i> much, even if their relationship is deteriorating or even becoming hostile. </aside></li>

<p>
A.&nbsp;  A readout preferably should list:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>significant points discussed, and</li>
<li>any decisions made.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These can be useful for follow-up and/or future reference — and, possibly, to help future readers (e.g., litigation counsel) to reconstruct a timeline of events.
</p>

<p>
A readout could be drafted jointly, for example while screensharing during a video call. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; A party's unilateral readout <i>might</i> have evidentiary significance, for example if it qualified as a "<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/business_records_exception">business record</a>" and thus as an exception to the rule excluding hearsay, such as <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_803">Fed.

<p>
Hi Alice; it was great talking to you on the Zoom call just now. Confirming part of our discussion: 
</p>

<p>
1. We discussed <i>[blah blah blah]</i> &#x2026;. 
</p>

<p>
2. We decided <i>[blah blah blah]</i> &#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
3.  <i>[continue with additional numbered paragraphs as needed]</i> 
</p>

<p>
Please let me know if there's anything else we need to discuss about this. 
</p>

<p>
Regards, Bob
</p>

</div>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> <i>Any</i> email should have an <i>informative</i> subject line, for easier spotting while scanning an email folder. For a call summary, the subject line might be something along the lines of: "[PARTY NAME] readout of phone call of [DATE] about [SUBJECT]," as illustrated above.
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> If circulating a readout, try not to get into what lawyers call "letter-writing wars" about what was or wasn't said, or promised, or agreed to.
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> Some video-conferencing platforms allow shared notetaking. That could make it practicable for one participant to serve as notetaker — with others offering real-time comments — and then to circulate a copy of the notes after the call. (<b>Caution:</b> Any party doing this should check the video-conferencing platform's terms of service and privacy policy to see whether that could: &bull; destroy trade-secret rights; &bull; waive attorney-client privilege, or &bull; illegally disclose personal information, e.g., personal health information or financial information.)

<p>
<i>The biggest cause of serious error in this business is a failure of communication.</i> <cite>  Construction executive Finn O'Sullivan, quoted in Atul Gawande, <a href="https://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/">The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</a> (2009), at 70. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Contract outcomes can be greatly improved — and sometimes, catastrophe averted — by habits of pre-planned communications, such as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>building contractors and subcontractors regularly check in with each other for status updates and to plan for upcoming events;</li>
<li>aircraft pilots regularly check in with air traffic control at standard points in their flights;</li>
<li>in surgeries, the surgeons announce to their teams what they're doing and what's coming next.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a subtext of <a href="https://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/">The Checklist Manifesto</a> (highly recommended reading, by way), by surgeon, Rhodes scholar, and MacArthur "genius grant" recipient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Gawande">Atul Gawande, M.D.</a> That book grew out of Gawande's <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist">article in The New Yorker</a>, recounting his visit to the construction site of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_Wharf">Russia Wharf</a>, a 32-floor building in Boston (now called the Atlantic Wharf). 
</p>

<p>
In that visit, Gawande learned that particular, <i>time-specific</i> communications were an important feature of the checklists used by the general contractor's construction executives:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
While no one could anticipate all the problems, they could foresee where and when they <i>might</i> occur. <i>The checklist therefore detailed who had to talk to whom, by which date, and about what aspect of construction</i> —who had to share (or 'submit') particular kinds of information before the next steps could proceed.
</p>

<p>
The submittal schedule specified, for instance, that by the end of the month the contractors, installers, and elevator engineers had to review the condition of the elevator cars traveling up to the tenth floor.
</p>

<p>
The elevator cars were factory constructed and tested. They were installed by experts. But it was not assumed that they would work perfectly. Quite the opposite. 
</p>

<p>
The assumption was that anything could go wrong, anything could get missed. What? Who knows? That’s the nature of complexity. 
</p>

<p>
But it was also assumed that, if you got the right people together and had them take a moment to talk things over as a team rather than as individuals, serious problems could be identified and averted. <cite> Atul Gawande, <a href="https://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/">The Checklist Manifesto</a> 65-66, emphasis and extra paragraphing added. </cite> 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To be sure: In many types of contract, such intensive communication might well be costly overkill. But more often, the problem is <i>too little</i> communication.

<b>An extra $100K expense:</b> Here's a less-costly example:  In a project to reconstruct a bridge, a subcontractor spent more than $120,000 above the agreed price in trying to resolve an unexpected problem. During ensuing payment litigation, the relevant parties learned that <i>if they'd just talked to one another</i>, they likely would agreed to an alternative approach that would have saved over $100,000 of that extra cost — and that doesn't even take into account the time and money the parties spent in litigation. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14405606239041277439">Constr.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org24f15ad">
<p>
A.&nbsp; As a contract negotiation progresses, the parties will typically send a series of emails, texts, etc., written messages going back and forth — different drafts of the contract; emails; text messages; etc. Those will often have inconsistent terms: Party A might propose a provision, Party B will reject the proposal, and perhaps the parties will compromise on a modified proposal.  
</p>

<p>
For that reason, contracts often include an entire-agreement statement, a.k.a. a "merger clause," a.k.a. an "integration clause," a.k.a. a "zipper clause." They do this to emphasize that only the final, signed agreement will count.
</p>

<p>
What this means for parties: If you want anything to count as part of the Con&shy;tract, in most jurisdictions you have to say it in the Con&shy;tract — or in one of the exhibits or schedules (see § <a href="#ent-k-exhib">2.4.2</a>) or documents incorporated by reference (see § <a href="#incorp-ref">4.3</a>).
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Under California law — consistent with what Professor Geoffrey Miller calls the state's "contextualist approach":
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The parties can, of course, include merger or integration clauses in their contracts in an attempt to shore up the parol evidence rule; but while these are afforded substantial respect under California law, <b>they are not conclusive</b> but rather considered along with other evidence of contract integration. Even if an integration clause is present and respected as regards the original terms of the contract, moreover, California recognizes <b>relatively easy modification by course of dealing</b> among the parties. <cite> Geoffrey P. Miller: <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1129805">Bargaining on the Red-Eye: New Light on Contract Theory</a>, NYU Law and Economics Research Paper No. 08-21, at 41-42 & nn.243-45 (emphasis added, footnotes omitted). </cite>

<p>
Courts have often held that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; where two or more written instruments are executed <b>as a part of one transaction</b> such instruments should, when possible, be <b>construed together</b>.

And this rule adheres <b>even</b> where the instruments do not in terms refer to each other.
</p>

<p>
Where multiple instruments are executed at the same time and are intertwined by the same subject matter, the parol evidence rule does not prevent the court from considering both or all agreements together, notwithstanding the presence of an integration clause. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7381479079212152029">Montes v.

<h5 id="ent-k-no-ext"><span class="section-number-5">2.4.6.3.</span> Should "no external <i>representations</i>" be said, too?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ent-k-no-ext">
<p>
Background: Even with an entire-agreement provision such as that of Protocol <a href="#r-ent-k">2.4</a>, sometimes a party to a contract (the "claimant") will claim:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>that the claimant was "fraudulently induced" to enter into the contract, due to <i>oral</i> assurances or other statements made by another party; and</li>

<li>that the other party therefore should be legally liable, even if technically the contract hasn't been breached.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Entire-agreement provisions often include "there are no other representations" language such as that above. 
</p>

<p>
And in <i>some</i> jurisdictions, such a no-other-<i>representations</i> statement might be enough to preclude a party from bringing a claim for fraudulent inducement. 
</p>

<p>
Example: New York law <i>sometimes</i> treats such "no other <i>representations</i>" disclaimers as inherently barring <i>reliance</i> on alleged external representations, and thus as barring claims of misrepresentation. But that happens only in specific circumstances, such as a transaction between large, sophisticated parties. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10301805490592806495">Century Pacific, Inc. v. Hilton Hotels Corp.</a>, 528 F. Supp. 2d 206, 229, 230-31 (S.D.N.Y 2007) (granting defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing misrepresentation claims), <i>aff'd</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2055880467675823739">No. 09-0545-cv</a>, slip op. (2d Cir. Nov. 25, 2009) (summary order). </cite>
</p>

<p>
For other circumstances, the express reliance waiver of Protocol <a href="#r-rel-discl">4.10</a> might be necessary.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-r-rel-discl-expr-rel">
<p>
In some circumstances — as in a Third Circuit case — a contract drafter might want to explicitly state that a party is <i>not</i> waiving reliance on outside statements but instead is indeed relying on such representations. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2607162530186989465">SodexoMAGIC, LLC v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ent-k-cmt-reps">
<p>
In a lawsuit between a married couple (the Harrells) and a general contractor (one Douglas DeLuca), the Fourth Circuit explained that —
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Virginia law distinguishes between[:]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a statement that is false when made and</li>

<li>a promise that becomes false only when the promisor later fails to keep his word.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The former is fraud, the latter is breach of contract. &#x2026; 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A statement by DeLuca to the effect of "I have already obtained the necessary permit(s)" is either true or false when made—it does not hinge on any future action—so, if false, it can support a claim for fraud.</li>

<li>Compare that to a statement by DeLuca to the effect of "I will obtain all necessary permits." That is merely a promise to do something in the future. And while it might constitute breach of contract if he fails to follow through, it cannot sustain a claim for fraud.  <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1980222022471186465">Harrell v. Deluca</a>, 97 F.4th 180, 190 (4th Cir. 2024) (vacating and remanding judgment for further fact findings; cleaned up, lightly edited). </cite></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
In footnote 7, the court noted a special case: "There is an exception to this categorical statement in cases where promises are made <i>with a present intention</i> not to perform them." (Cleaned up.)
</p>

<p>
Similarly, Delaware's chancery court noted the difference between a <i>factual</i> misrepresentation and an alleged lie about <i>future intentions</i>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The gravamen of Plaintiff's fraudulent inducement claim is that Albertsons lied about its "future intent" with respect to the operation of the business post-closing. 
</p>

<p>
While anti-reliance language is needed to stand as a contractual bar to an extra-contractual fraud claim based on <i>factual misrepresentations</i>, an integration clause alone is sufficient to bar a fraud claim based on expressions of <i>future intent</i> or future <i>promises</i>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14131654157708706561">Shareholder Repr.

<p>
Texas's supreme court similarly observed:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To recover for fraud, Petitioners must prove: <i>[list of usual elements omitted]</i>. Because the representation in this case involves a promise to do an act in the future, Petitioners also had to prove that, <i>at the time</i> the Bank's representative made the promise, <i>the Bank had no intention</i> of performing the act. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1784286394171873630">T.O.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ent-k-fr-ind-c">
<p>
An entire-agreement clause usually won't block a claim for fraudulent inducement to enter into the contract in the first place. For that, a drafter would have to include either an express reliance waiver (see Protocol <a href="#r-rel-discl">4.10</a>) or — in some jurisdictions only — a simple statement that there are no external representations (see § <a href="#ent-k-no-ext">2.4.6.3</a>).

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-exhib-what-cmt">
<p>
A contract exhibit is generally a standalone document attached to (or referenced in) a contract. Exhibits are often used as prenegotiated forms of follow-on documents such as forms of real-estate deed.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a commercial real-estate contract between ABC and XYZ, the contract might well include, <i>as an exhibit</i>, an agreed form of warranty deed; the contract might say the following, for example: 
</p>

<div class="alt" id="org2da0902">
<p>
&#x2026; At the Closing (subject to Buyer's fulfillment of Buyer's obligations under this Agreement), Seller will deliver to Buyer a general warranty deed <i>in substantially the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A</i>.
</p>

</div>

<p>
(Emphasis added.)  
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A master services agreement (MSA) might include, as an exhibit, a starter template for statements of work (SOW) to be undertaken under the MSA. 
</p>

<p>
(<i>Caution:</i> The MSA should not <i>require</i> a SOW to be in the form of the SOW exhibit. That's because, for a particular project, the parties might use a different form of SOW but still want to use the MSA.)
</p>

<p>
<i>Exhibit numbering:</i> Contract exhibits are commonly "numbered" as Exhibit A, B, etc., but that's just a convention. Exhibits could alternatively be numbered with numerals, such as Exhibit 1, 2, etc., or even by reference to section numbers in the body of the contract (see the discussion of schedules below). The important thing is to make it easy for future readers to locate specific exhibits.

<p>
In other words:

<li>the schedule(s) specify the ways (if any) in which the Company (in this case, BindView) did <i>not</i> conform to that benchmark status.</li>

<p>
<i>Schedule numbering:</i> It's conventional to number  each schedule according to the section in the body of the agreement in which the schedule is primarily referenced; in the example above, Schedule 3.2 has the same number as section 3.2 of the merger agreement in which that schedule is referenced.

<p>
A trial court denied a motion to compel arbitration, reasoning that the exhibit language meant what it said. But the state supreme court disagreed, asserting that "[a]n arbitration clause and a forum selection clause are not necessarily mutually exclusive because arbitration and litigation are not mutually exclusive." The court distinguished another case in which an addendum had explicitly <i>ruled out</i> arbitration. <cite> <i>See id.</i> ¶¶ 19, 21-22. </cite>

<i>Mandatory</i> internal escalation of disagreements, for all parties to a contract, can help promote <i>early</i> resolution — <i>before</i> people get irritated and mulish and start to dig their heels in. This is due to a reality of life in the business world, pointed out by three notable contract scholars: "Superiors are unlikely to look with favor on subordinates who send problems up the line for resolution.

<p>
PARTIES: Give some thought to doing one or both of the following things —
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>exchanging written position statements, with the goal of providing your respective managements with a first-hand, <i>unfiltered</i> view of your position; and <aside> Even just the act of <i>producing</i> written position statements could help the parties' people figure out what their positions <i>really</i> are in the disagreement; that could speed up resolution. </aside></li>

<li>exchanging relevant documents as early as practicable — under Protocol <a href="#r-conf-info-proto">11.3</a> (confidential information) if so agreed. <aside> If litigation were to ensue, <i>B</i> would likely get access to many of <i>A</i>'s relevant, <a href="#nl-atty-priv-c">non-privileged</a> documents anyway. So it'll often make sense to just "get on with it" — perhaps under a suitable confidentiality agreement — to save time and legal expense for all concerned. </aside></li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-r-escal-ext-when">
<p>
The parties: Escalate, to a neutral advisor, any persistent disagreement relating to the Con&shy;tract, as stated in this Protocol, whenever either of you <a href="#rsnbl-top">reasonably</a> asks — but do this <i>after</i> you've both escalated internally (unless otherwise agreed) in accordance with Protocol <a href="#r-escal-int">2.5</a>.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Like internal escalation under Protocol <a href="#r-escal-int">2.5</a>, this Protocol aims to increase the chances of early settlement of disputes — and thus to help avoid costly litigation — by giving parties and their counsel a "sanity check" before positions harden and relationships suffer.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; This Protocol's reasonableness requirement can serve as a guardrail against a wealthier party's attempts to bully another party by inappropriate demands for escalation (e.g., repetitive demands, or demands concerning trivial disagreements).

</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The parties could consider agreeing in advance to a list of acceptable neutrals; in some cases, the parties might even want to agree to engage a specific neutral at the time they enter into the Con&shy;tract — this could be along the general lines of an expert engineering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispute_board">dispute resolution board</a>, as is sometimes used in complex construction projects.

<li>Any such first-round proposal could state that it's a firm offer to settle on the proposed terms. Otherwise, though, each such proposal will be just a suggestion of a possibility for further discussion.</li>

<p>
A.&nbsp; Two experienced arbitrators in New York City point out that <i>successive</i> rounds of settlement proposals can nudge each party into assessing whether <i>the other party's</i> proposal might look better <i>to the neutral</i>. This can nudge each party into (re)considering the reasonableness of that party's position — and thus, in turn, improve the odds of settlement. B.&nbsp; The contents of each party's proposal would of course be up to that party, but could include, for example, terms for allocating (i) fees and expenses charged by the neutral; and/or (ii) the parties' respective attorney fees. <cite> See Edna Sussman and Erin Gleason, <a href="https://sussmanadr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Baseball-arbitration-NYSBA-Sussman-3-2019.pdf">Everyone Can Be a Winner in Baseball Arbitration: History and Practical Guidance</a> (sussmanadr.com), in N.Y.

</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Each party could provide <i>alternative proposals</i> to try to advance the prospect of settlement. EXAMPLE: Such an approach seems to have been used in a federal court case, involving an organization at MIT, where by agreement, the trial judge served as a baseball-style mediator <i>[sic]</i> who chose between the parties' final settlement offers. The court's opinion noted that: "Each side could submit two positions, but I encouraged counsel to limit its submission to one or two positions and instructed each side to submit the same number of positions. I would then adopt one of the positions."  <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4098487772116521400">Brandt v. MIT Development Corp.</a>, 552 F. Supp. 2d 304 n.6 (D. Conn. 2008). </cite>

D.&nbsp; A party could submit an "exploding" proposal that is deemed withdrawn at a stated time if not agreed to as part of the first round.

Subdivision 2: A possible alternative is known as "<b>night baseball</b>," in which the neutral <b>isn't</b> told what the parties are proposing, but simply states which party wins. <i>DCT comment:</i> My own thinking is that night baseball would be less-effective than giving the neutral the whole picture, so that the neutral can offer comments and suggestions about how to bridge the gap between the parties' settlement positions.

Why might senior management make a difference? As two Australian lawyers pointed out: "Bringing in senior management will focus the minds of the parties on the bottom line, and allows senior decision makers who are not caught up in the underlying dispute to approach the situation taking commercial reality into account." <cite> Faith Laube and Toby Blyth, <a href="http://www.mybusiness.com.au/special-features/special-feature-expert-determination-clauses-in-contracts-are-they-worth-it">Expert determination clauses in contracts — are they worth it?</a> (MyBusiness.com.au), archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/T2FP-D9BZ">https://perma.cc/T2FP-D9BZ</a>. </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-r-escal-ext-mtrl">
<p>
NEUTRAL: At the video conference, give each party a reasonable opportunity to do a <i>brief</i>, "closing argument" presentation concerning the dispute, in the same general manner as for a mini-trial.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1e6202e" class="outline-6 cmtry">
<h6 id="org1e6202e">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org1e6202e">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Each party would make a presentation during the video conference, in the style of a closing argument in a lawsuit, succinctly summarizing the party's position and any supporting evidence. But each party is free not to make a presentation, or for that matter not to participate in the video conference at all.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; It's helpful for the proceeding to generally follow the <a href="https://drs.cpradr.org/rules/international/mediation/cpr-minitrial-procedure">mini-trial rules</a> published by the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution ("CPR").
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; The neutral would decide whether to allow recording of the video conference if the parties disagreed on that point.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; The neutral would allocate presentation time roughly equally between the parties.
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; The neutral would normally manage the conference in roughly the same way that a federal judge might manage a closing argument.
</p>

<p>
(The neutral will presumably rein in a party whose presentations — after reasonable warning and opportunity to cure — are repetitive or unproductive.)
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; Usually, the video conference wouldn't continue for more than roughly 90 minutes. (The neutral and the parties could of course agree otherwise.)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-r-escal-ext-cmt">
<p>
NEUTRAL: You're welcome to express thoughts about any of the parties' proposals (1) to both parties together, and/or (2)  to each party separately, subject generally to the ethical guidelines applicable in mediations — the idea is to see if the parties might be able to settle the dispute without your having to choose between their final proposals. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-r-escal-ext-cmt-c" class="outline-6 cmtry">
<h6 id="r-escal-ext-cmt-c">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-r-escal-ext-cmt-c">
<p>
A.&nbsp; The neutral's comments could include suggestions for bridging any remaining gap(s) between the parties. That's because this Protocol uses a hybrid of two different approaches to <i>ex parte</i> communications:  (1) In <b>mediation</b>, "shuttle diplomacy" is an often-used feature, with the mediator trying to broker a deal. (2) In contrast, in <b>litigation</b> and <b>conventional arbitration</b>, it's almost always considered improper and unfair for the judge or arbitrator to engage in private, "<i>ex parte</i>" communications with one of the parties to the dispute.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Moreover, § <a href="#r-escal-ext-neut-rec">2.6.11</a> allows, after the neutral chooses the winning proposal, for the neutral to do something akin to a "mediator's proposal" in mediation. 
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; True: Mediator proposals are regarded skeptically by some mediators. But the neutral will already have chosen one of the party proposals and announced that choice to the parties, along with a brief explanation. So a neutral's proposal at that point seems likely to present fewer potential dangers. <cite> See generally, e.g., Martin Quinn, <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/files/uploads/documents/quinn_mediationproposals_law_2014-11-25.pdf">Mediator’s proposals: God’s gift to mediation, or a betrayal?</a> (JAMSADR.com 2014) (discussing pros and cons); Wynne S.

EXAMPLE: Some might wonder whether the lawyers for fired CNN anchor Chris Cuomo were seeking to use this tactic in an arbitration between Cuomo and CNN. Nearly a year into the arbitration, the ex-anchor sought to disqualify the arbitrator. (This was after the arbitrator had already issued dozens of case-management orders without objection from Cuomo.) On what grounds, you might ask? More than 20 years earlier, the arbitrator, then a law-firm attorney, had handled one small matter for CNN, and the arbitrator's firm had represented CNN in other matters. The arbitrator stated in his disclosure (and later in a sworn affidavit) that he didn't remember any of those matters. The trial court rebuffed Cuomo's disqualification attempt; the appellate division unanimously affirmed — and awarded CNN its costs for the appeal.  <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14631317388254400062">Cuomo v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-baseball-rsnbl">
<p>
This Protocol borrows key, compromise-promoting features from last-offer arbitration as used in baseball salary disputes. Such arbitration very often results in early settlement, because <i>each party has a powerful incentive to be reasonable:</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The arbitrators <i>must choose</i> one of final proposals put forward by the parties; and</li>

<li>An <i>unreasonable</i> proposal would likely cause the arbitrators to choose the other party's proposal, even if just as the lesser of two evils.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a baseball writer once put it, baseball arbitration is "designed to produce a <b>settlement</b>, not a <b>verdict</b>." Judges have noted this reasonableness incentive in non-baseball cases <cite> Thomas Gorman, <i>The Arbitration Process &#x2013; the Basics</i>, in Baseball Prospectus (2005) (<a href="http://perma.cc/CZR4-9XC7">http://perma.cc/CZR4-9XC7</a>) (emphasis added). </cite>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In a federal case involving an organization at MIT, the trial judge, acting as a "mediator" by agreement, remarked that "each side therefore had an incentive to set forth a position that was as reasonable as possible."</li>
<li>A Missouri appellate court noted that final-offer arbitration "is designed to motivate each party to negotiate in good faith and attempt to compromise in order to create a final offer that the arbitrator will select as most reasonable." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8125228188179346982">Kagan v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-escal-apprai">
<p>
The Delaware chancery court described another dispute-resolution procedure that's sometimes seen in valuation disputes:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
That procedure calls for the parties to agree on an appraiser to value the plaintiff's share of the transaction proceeds.
</p>

<p>
If the two sides can't agree &#x2026; then each side picks an appraiser. 
</p>

<p>
After each appraiser prepares a valuation, the appraisers meet and attempt to reach agreement on a valuation. 
</p>

<p>
If the appraisers can't agree &#x2026; then the two appraisers pick a third appraiser.
</p>

<p>
<b>That <i>[third]</i> appraiser <i>chooses one</i> of the two valuations</b>, which establishes the amount due. * * *
</p>

<p>
<i>[The agreed procedure stated that the third appraiser]</i> "shall select from the determinations of the two <i>[appraisers]</i> <b>the determination that it believes to be most correct</b>, which shall then become <b>final, conclusive and binding</b> on the parties hereto." #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8126733645927116877">Paul v.

Historical data suggest that final-offer arbitration works very, very well to promote settlement of baseball salary disputes: If I'm reading the statistics correctly, there were a total of approximately 1,000 arbitration-eligible players for the years between 2018 and 2022; in those years, the settlement rate ranged between <b>89%</b> and <b>96%</b> — with <b>100%</b> settlement in 2022. True: Baseball salary disputes involve a comparatively-narrow range of hard data (batting average, on-base percentage, wins above replacement, etc.). Here are some <b>non-baseball</b> examples where baseball-style "final offer" arbitration has been used to resolve disputes <cite> See Arbitration Tracker<a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/arbtracker2018;%20"> 2018</a>, <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/arbtracker2019">2019</a>, <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/arbtracker2020">2020</a>, <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/arbtracker2021">2021</a>, and <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/arbtracker2022">2022</a>.

AT&T, Inc.</a>, 916 F.3d 1029, 1034-35 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (refers to provision in Comcast-NBC Universal merger agreement allowing distributors to submit disputes to baseball arbitration, and to Turner Broadcasting's offer to do the same with approximately 1,000 distributors); see also <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/492201/download">Suppl.

And an anecdote from a lawyer friend: At a conference in the same time frame, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-daunt-934a051/">Jackie Daunt</a> <i>[who gave me permission to use her name]</i>, then a partner at a leading Silicon Valley firm (and now retired), told me that she routinely put baseball-arbitration clauses into her clients' contracts. One of those clients got into a dispute, causing the client's CEO to exclaim angrily, "G**d*mn it, Jackie, that means I have to be <i>reasonable</i>!" Jackie responded, "Exactly." And of course the dispute was settled — sooner than it might otherwise have been. 
</p>

<p>
(In a recent email to me, Jackie remarked that baseball arbitration "penalized someone who was unreasonable and, as you highlighted in your story, led to faster, cheaper and fairer resolutions of disputes.  Probably the very reason it never became popular.")

<h5 id="r-escal-ext-appl"><span class="section-number-5">2.6.25.4.</span> What sorts of dispute might qualify for escalation?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-r-escal-ext-appl">
<p>
Prime candidates for escalation to a neutral advisor would be any actual controversy, relating to the Con&shy;tract, concerning any of the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>numbers, for example, how much one party is to pay another; and/or</li>

<li>imprecise requirements under the Con&shy;tract — for example, what would constitute <i>reasonable efforts</i> in a given situation. disagreement relating to the Con&shy;tract.</li>
</ol>

<p>
(The mention of an "actual controversy" has in mind the requirements of the Declaratory Judgment Act, discussed at <a href="#nl-DJAct">23.23</a>. That's because it might <i>not</i> be reasonable to demand costly escalation to a neutral if there's no actual controversy to escalate.)
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples of disagreements that would almost surely qualify for escalation under this Protocol:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the amount(s) of one or more sums that, under the Con&shy;tract, one party is to pay to another party — because disputes about numbers are the classic use case of the baseball-arbitration aspect of this Protocol, as discussed at <a href="#baseball-success-cmt">2.6.25.3</a>.</li>

<li>whether particular action (as yet untaken) would satisfy an imprecise requirement under the Con&shy;tract such as, for example, a requirement to make "reasonable efforts" or "commercially-reasonable efforts" (see Protocol <a href="#r-comm-rsnbl">13.2</a>) or "best efforts" (see Protocol <a href="#r-best-efforts-defn">13.1</a>);</li>

<li>whether a party has "good reason" to take or not take a particular action, where the Con&shy;tract allows the party to take or not take the action if good reason exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Of course, the parties could always agree to follow this Protocol for other disagreements.

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to have to pay overtime to the vendor's employees if the vendor doesn't do so. That could end up being a big number. For example, a medical-staffing agency was held to have misclassified nurses as independent contractors.

<li>to pay employment taxes for the vendor's employees; or <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10232089801031084495">Chavez-DeRemer v.

A court might give little or no weight to a declaration such as that this Protocol; precedent from the (U.S.) Supreme Court makes it clear that "there is no shorthand formula or magic phrase" for independent-contractor status. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17948890150151968074">NLRB v.

<h5 id="ps-defn-cmt"><span class="section-number-5">2.7.3.2.</span> Saying "we're not <i>partners</i>" tries to avoid a possible danger</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ps-defn-cmt">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Subdivision 1 tries to put a Band-Aid® on a common business situation that theoretically could be dangerous (although my limited research didn't indicate that actual trouble ever happened): 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When companies do business together, their people will often refer to each other as "partners."</li>

<li>This is especially true in the sales world, where the term "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_partner">channel partner</a>" typically refers to a reseller, distributor, systems integrator, etc. that operates in "the [sales] channel."</li>
</ul>

<p>
Subdivision 1's disclaimer of partnership status is fairly typical; it's based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130904215546/http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/partnership/upa_final_97.pdf#page=54">section 304(a)</a> of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130904215546/http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/partnership/upa_final_97.pdf">Revised Uniform Partnership Act (1997)</a> — but that section requires the <i>filing</i> of a partnership disclaimer to have the disclaimer binding on strangers to the relationship. (Section 304(a) might not be in effect in all states adopting the RUPA.)
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Why</b> might it be dangerous for parties to refer to themselves as "partners"? Because in the U.S., an important feature of partnership, for example under Texas statute, is that "&#x2026; all partners are jointly and severally liable for all obligations of the partnership &#x2026;." 
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; So what counts as a "partnership"? The term is typically defined, for example in a Texas statute, as follows:  
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026; an association of two or more persons to carry on a business for profit as owners creates a partnership, <b>regardless</b> of whether: 
</p>

<p>
1.  the persons <b>intend</b> to create a partnership; or
</p>

<p>
2.  <i>the association is <b>called</b> a "partnership,"</i> "joint venture," or other name. <cite> <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BO/htm/BO.152.htm#152.051">Tex. Bus. Org. Code § 152.051(b)</a> (emphasis added, exceptions omitted); see also <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BO/htm/BO.152.htm#152.052">§ 152.052</a> (rules for determining if partnership is created). The first part of this definition is essentially a verbatim adoption of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130904215546/http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/partnership/upa_final_97.pdf#page=15">section 101(6)</a> of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130904215546/http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/partnership/upa_final_97.pdf">Revised Uniform Partnership Act (1997)</a>. </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
D.&nbsp; This means that when two parties refer to themselves as partners, they could be setting themselves up to be fully responsible for each other's debts and liabilities.
</p>

<p>
Here's a hypothetical example: Fred and Ginger decide to give dancing lessons; they rent space in a "strip mall" shopping center and remodel it to serve as a dance studio. They don't form a corporation or limited-liability company (LLC); in fact, they do no paperwork at all, other than each of them signing the lease for the studio space. Fred and Ginger sometimes refer to each other as "my partner."
</p>

<p>
But then one Sunday afternoon, when the dance studio is closed, Fred gets in his car to run a few errands — and those errands include picking up supplies for the studio. Fred runs a red light, hitting and severely injuring a pedestrian in the crosswalk.
</p>

<p>
The pedestrian likely will sue not just Fred, but also Ginger — and on the hypothetical facts here, it's not impossible that Ginger could be <i>personally</i> liable for the full amount of the pedestrian's medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering, even though Fred was the one who ran the red light.

<h5 id="c-indep-fid"><span class="section-number-5">2.7.3.3.</span> Why disclaim "agent" or "fiduciary" status?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-c-indep-fid">
<p>
A dissatisfied contracting party could allege that the other party breached a fiduciary duty or some other relationship of trust and confidence.  EXAMPLE: At the trial in a Nebraska case, three different witnesses testified, without contradiction, that in a construction contract the "industry standard" is that: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
a cost-plus arrangement creates <i>a relationship of trust between the general contractor and customer</i>, that the items on a customer’s invoice represent project-related bills that need to be paid, and that the general contractor will pay those bills with the corresponding funds the customer provides the general contractor. &#x2026; [T]he customer’s funds are not to be used to pay for non-project-specific related costs, and that to do so is a misappropriation of the customer’s funds. <cite>
<a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/nebraska/supreme-court/2026/s-23-947.html">Perkins, L.L.C.  v. RMR Building Grp., LLC</a>, 320 Nebr. 707, 713 (2026) (reversing court of appeals and remanding with instructions to affirm trial court's refusal to pierce defendant's corporate veil; emphasis added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But a court might well honor a contract's disclaimer of fiduciary obligations. EXAMPLE: After the stock market dropped in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, an investor ordered his wealth adviser to liquidate his entire portfolio — and then, after losing millions of dollars, he sued the adviser, claiming that the adviser had breached his fiduciary duty by failing to "explain every potential downside or loss that [the investor] ultimately experienced." The D.C. Circuit affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the investor's claims; relevant here, the parties agreed that yes, the wealth adviser was a fiduciary, <b>but</b> the parties' investment agreement had limited the adviser's obligations. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8923059459420319423">Goodrich v. Bank of America N.A.</a>, 136 F.4th 347, 352 (D.C. Cir. 2025) (affirming dismissal). </cite>
</p>

<p>
So, § <a href="#indep-k-intent">2.7.1</a> is a guardrail term, because you might not want to deal with a counterparty that might someday claim that you were the counterparty's "agent" or "<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp">fiduciary</a>" and therefore legally obligated to give the counterparty's interests priority above the first party's own interests. EXAMPLE: Such a claim occurred, for example, in a case in which New York's highest court rejected a claim of breach of fiduciary duty. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5555317030447812009">Pappas v. Tzolis</a>, 20 N.Y.3d 228, 233-34 (2012). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Delaware's chancery court rejected investors' fiduciary-duty claims when the contract in question had disavowed such duties:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The LLC Agreement also included broad waivers of the WP Investors’ fiduciary duties in four provisions. It stated that the WP Investors and their affiliates owed no fiduciary or other duties to the Company or its members beyond the duty to comply with the LLC Agreement. It further provided that each WP investor was permitted to "act exclusively in . . . its own interest and without regard to the interest of any other person," so long as it complied with the LLC Agreement. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1758938192898725615">Khan v. Warburg Pincus, LLC</a>, No. 2024-0523, slip op. at 4-5, text acc. nn.16-18 (Del. Ch. Apr. 30, 2025), <i>aff'd w/o opinion</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3239523509958729729">No. 236, 2025</a>. (Del. Dec. 9, 2025). The chancery court also rejected the plaintiff's attempt to get around the fiduciary-duty waiver: "Because the limited liability agreement leaves no room for a quasi-fiduciary theory disguised as an implied covenant claim, this case is dismissed." <i>Id.</i>, slip op. at 2. </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>




<p>
EXAMPLE: Similarly, in a Texas Business Court case, a minority member of an LLC brought a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the LLC's majority member and sole manager, who had expelled the minority member. But the LLC's operating agreement (known in Texas as a "company agreement") stated that "no special relationship shall exist between any Manager and the Members, and no Member or Manager shall have any duty to any Member, whether fiduciary or otherwise, except as expressly set forth herein (or in other written agreements)." The court quickly disposed of the fiduciary-duty claim as precluded by the contract provision:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Under Texas law, courts must honor the contractual terms that parties use to define the scope of their obligations and agreements, including those that restrict fiduciary duties that might otherwise exist. This is especially true when the contractual limitation arises from an arms-length business transaction between sophisticated businesspeople. This principle adheres to Texas’s longstanding public policy of freedom of contract. <cite> <a href="https://www.txcourts.gov/media/1460352/25-bc08a-0002-hall-v-vanderhoef-memorandum-opinion.pdf#page=13">Tall v.

</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
E.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> A court might disregard a proclamation that "they're not our agents!" if the <i>facts</i> show otherwise. As with independent-contractor status, merely <i>saying</i> "oh, no, there's no <i>agency</i> relationship <i>here</i>" won't make it so if the parties conduct themselves otherwise. EXAMPLE: This was illustrated in <i>DISH Network</i> (2020), a Seventh Circuit case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The trial court concluded that DISH Network <i>and its agents</i> had violated telemarketing statutes and regulations (some 65 million violations, apparently). The court imposed a penalty <i>on DISH</i> of $280 million (!).</li>

<li>In (mostly) affirming the judgment, the appeals court noted that "[t]he contract <i>[between DISH and its representatives]</i> asserts that it does not create an agency relation, but <i>parties cannot by ukase negate agency</i> if the relation the contract creates is <i>substantively</i> one of agency." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10574700750058443453">United States v. DISH Network LLC</a>, 954 F.3d 970, 975 (7th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted, emphasis edited). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
F.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Even with a disclaimer like this, a court could find that a "fiduciary" relationship had arisen from the partiular facts, for example if one party "exercises excessive control" over another. This was illustrated in a case in which a federal district court denied lender-defendants' motions for summary judgment: The court said that "[i]f a lender exercises excessive control over a borrower, &#x2026; a lender can assume the role of a fiduciary rather than a mere creditor" and that "the evidentiary record &#x2026; cumulatively serve[s] to demonstrate, at the very least, a triable question of Wallis Bank assuming the role of fiduciary rather than mere creditor through myriad actions that demonstrate excessive control." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1336808931311598445">Beaumont Lamar Apartments, LLC v. Wallis Bank</a>, No. 4:23-cv-00341-O, slip op. at part III.B.2 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 6, 2024) (cleaned up, lightly edited). </cite>

<p>
By the way ("BTW"): Suppose that Alice and Bob enter into a contract.  If Alice is found to be Bob's "agent," then (in general) Alice may deal with third parties, e.g., Carol, on Bob's behalf <i>and make contractual commitments to Carol that are legally binding on Bob</i>. 
</p>

<p>
(For that reason, in Bob's contract with Alice, Bob might want to state specifically that Alice <i>isn't</i> her agent, as in § <a href="#c-indep-fid">2.7.3.3</a>.)

<p>
And now let's suppose that Alice and Bob <i>agreed</i> that Alice would be Bob's agent, and in fact, Bob's <i>exclusive</i> agent: Even under those circumstances, at least under Texas law, Bob would still be free to make a deal with Carol without getting Alice involved and without paying Alice any kind of commission.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-indep-k-dol">
<p>
In January 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the finalization of a revised rule to undo a Trump adminstration last-minute definition of independent-contractor status: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The new "independent contractor" rule <b>restores the multifactor analysis used by courts</b> for decades, ensuring that all relevant factors are analyzed to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. 
</p>

<p>
The rule addresses <b>six factors</b> that guide the analysis of a worker’s relationship with an employer, including any opportunity for profit or loss a worker might have; the financial stake and nature of any resources a worker has invested in the work; the degree of permanence of the work relationship; the degree of control an employer has over the person’s work; whether the work the person does is essential to the employer’s business; and a factor regarding the worker’s skill and initiative. The rule separately rescinds the <i>[Trump administration's]</i> 2021 Independent Contractor Rule that the department believes is not consistent with the law and longstanding judicial precedent. <cite> See <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20240109-1">News Release</a> (DOL.gov 2024) (formatting edited); see generally, e.g., <a href="https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/us-department-labor-finalizes-independent-contractor-regulation">MacDonald et al.</a> (Littler.com 2024). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Biden DOL's announcement was not greeted with universal acclaim; as one management-side law firm posted, the final rule "skew[s] the inquiry in favor of employee status. &#x2026; While on the one hand this <i>[six-factor test]</i> may seem to lead to greater flexibility, it blurs lines, leads to inconsistent results, and provides businesses and workers little of the clarity that rulemaking on worker status was supposed to provide." <cite> <a href="https://www.seyfarth.com/news-insights/department-of-labor-issues-final-rule-on-independent-contractor-definition-under-the-fair-labor-standards-act.html">McKinley & Winnick</a> (Seyfarth.com 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, in 2025 the second Trump administration changed things yet again, as summarized by another management-side law firm:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
As expected with a change in the White House, and as very recently foretold in Department of Labor court filings, the Trump DOL announced via a Field Assistance Bulletin on May 1 that it will no longer enforce a 2024 Biden-era independent contractor rule under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). While this announcement does not formally rescind the Biden-era rule, the DOL explained that it will be reconsidering the rule, and it is virtually certain that the DOL will dramatically change or replace the rule when its review is completed. <cite> Michael Gotzler, <a href="https://www.littler.com/news-analysis/asap/dol-hits-pause-enforcement-biden-era-independent-contractor-rule-suggests-new-or">DOL Hits Pause on Enforcement of Biden-Era Independent Contractor Rule, Suggests New or Changed Rule Forthcoming</a> (Littler.com). </cite>

<h5 id="indep-k-nlrb"><span class="section-number-5">2.7.3.6.</span> The Biden Administration's NLRB weighed in &#x2026;</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-indep-k-nlrb">
<p>
In 2021, the then-new general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Abruzzo">Jennifer Abruzzo</a>, appointed by President Biden that she intended to revisit a number of employer-friendly decisions from the Trump-era Board about independent-contractor status, notably including <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/16-RC-010963">SuperShuttle DFW, Inc.</a>, <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/16-RC-010963">367 NLRB No. 75</a> (2019).
</p>

<p>
Then in 2023, the Board issued its <i>Atlanta Opera</i> decision (<a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/cases-decisions/weekly-summaries-decisions/summary-of-nlrb-decisions-for-week-of-june-12-16-2023">372 NLRB No. 95</a>), overruling <i>SuperShuttle DFW</i> and holding that "in the context of weighing all relevant, traditional common-law factors, including those identified in the Restatement, the Board will also consider whether the evidence tends to show that the putative independent contractor is, in fact, rendering services as part of an independent business." <cite> The Board's <i>Atlanta Opera</i> decision was summarized by <a href="https://www.foxrothschild.com/publications/nlrb-departs-from-employer-friendly-independent-contractor-test">MacDonald & Veslinovic</a> (2023). </cite>
</p>

<p>
At this writing (January 2026), I can't find anything online to indicate that the Trump 2.0 NLRB has taken action to revisit this issue. That's likely due to the fact that the Board currently <a href="https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/president-trump-nominates-two-for-nlrb-potentially-restoring-quorum/">doesn't have a quorum</a>: President Trump <a href="https://www.fisherphillips.com/en/news-insights/scotus-once-again-upholds-firing-of-nlrb-democrat-member-wilcox.html">purported to fire</a> Biden-appointed Board member <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwynne_Wilcox">Gwynne Wilcox</a> (he <a href="https://www.littler.com/news-analysis/asap/white-house-terminates-national-labor-relations-board-general-counsel-jennifer">also fired</a> the Board's general counsel Abruzzo) just a week after he returned to the White House.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-indep-k-cali">
<p>
In 2019, the California legislature enacted a statute, known as <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB5">AB 5</a>, which added a new section 2750.3 (later repealed) to the California Labor Code, setting out a three-part <i>initial</i> test for whether someone is an independent contractor instead of an employee. The statute, however — and a subsequent amendment — goes on to set forth carve-outs for certain occupations that are worth a careful review. <cite> The statutory list of carve-outs from AB 5 was expanded in a subsequent bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2257">AB 2257</a>; see, e.g., <a href="https://www.calpeculiarities.com/2019/12/12/somethings-afoot-in-tinsel-town-new-laws-for-the-entertainment-industry/">Gross & Rodine</a> (2019); <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/contracts-and-commercial-law/982436/expanding-independent-contractors-in-california-new-law-awaits-governor39s-signature">Kim et al.</a> (2020). </cite>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Gig-economy companies Uber, Lyft, and others didn't take California's AB 5 lying down: They funded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_California_Proposition_22">Proposition 22</a>, a ballot initiative classifying certain app-based drivers as independent contractors. That initiative passed with more than 58% of the vote.

A.&nbsp;  Where contracts are concerned, generally speaking a "notice" would be a communication to do something along the following lines: (1) to formally communicate a fact or opinion relevant to the Con&shy;tract, for example, the fact that the contract had been assigned (see generally the commentary at Protocol <a href="#r-assmt-consent">17.3</a>); and/or (2) to formally invoke a specific right or obligation under the Con&shy;tract, such as, for example: making a demand; exercising a right; or terminating the Con&shy;tract.
</p>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgc4b2007">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Alternative: "Emojis in a notice have no effect."
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The problem: Emojis in a notice could be problematic, because they might have multiple meanings. "Use your words!" is sound advice for contract notices, not least because emojis can be susceptible to disagreements about their meaning. See, for example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The so-called "<a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tech/a790669/is-this-a-poop-or-an-ice-cream-emoji-one-of-lifes-big-questions-answered/">chocolate ice cream</a>" emoji &#x1F4A9, which, ahem, might not actually mean that; and</li>

<li>the so-called water emoji &#x1f4a6 — as noted by one court, "while water [emojis] may reference sexual relations, case law also confirms that water can also refer to methamphetamine in drug trafficking communications."</li>
</ul>
<p>
C.&nbsp; Still: People do sometimes use emojis in their writing. So: This section allows for the possibility that in some circumstances, it <i>might</i> make sense for emojis to be given effect in a notice under a contract. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4355235062637372867">United States v. Swanagan</a>, No. 4:22CR-00003-JHM (W.D. Ky. Jan. 3, 2023) (denying motion to suppress LEO's affidavit; citation omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; But what if an emoji is ambiguous, as in the examples above? Let's play it safe: If an emoji in a notice could plausibly have more than one meaning, then let's treat it like a blank space — if doing that makes the notice incomplete or even incoherent, then so be it: The notice should have been clear.
</p>

<p>
(This takes a harder line than the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule of interpretation that ambiguities aren't ignored, they're construed against the drafter; see <a href="#r-contra-prof">14.1</a>.)

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> Many notices clauses specify <i>mandatory</i> addresses for notice; such provisions are often cumbersome and might be best avoided — although they might be appropriate in some circumstances, and moreover a court might look at the circumstances to determine whether a notice to the "wrong" address was ineffective, or was effective anyway, as discussed in the commentary at <a href="#notice-rcv-cmt">2.8.13.5</a>.

<p>
A.&nbsp; An "Attention: <i>[Position]</i>" line can help to reduce the chances of a notice going astray or falling through the cracks — for example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>an <i>individual</i> addressee might not be in the same job any more; and</li>

<li>the addressee's mailroom people might set aside the notice until they could figure out what to do with it — and they might <i>never</i> get around to it until too late. (Something close to this happened in <i>CEEG</i> (10th Cir. 2016), discussed in the commentary at § <a href="#arb-ntc-lang">23.1.6</a>.)</li>

B.&nbsp; <b>But:</b> Any such requirement should be quite clear that the "Attention:" line is mandatory, not merely preferred.

The court held that this was <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/precatory">precatory</a> (that is, expressing a wish) and not mandatory, and so the insured's failure to send notice to the Claims Department did not <i>automatically</i> justify denial of coverage. The court added, though: "Even though we hold that Lonergan reported her claim under the Policy, <i>we decline to reach the issue</i> of whether she breached the Policy's notice conditions <i>or whether any such breach may have prejudiced Landmark</i>." EXAMPLE: The Third Circuit held that "we join a growing line of cases prohibiting an <i>insured</i> from insisting that its <i>insurer's</i> underwriting department sift through a renewal application and decide what should be forwarded to the claims department on the insured's behalf. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8783660929879759720">Am.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org904f880">
<p>
A.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> By law, some types of contract might require — or bar — specific types of notice-delivery methods in particular situations and jurisdictions, as discussed at <a href="#notice-law">2.8.13.2</a>.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Parties should keep in mind that emails and especially text messages might disappear. (This is one of the points discussed at <a href="#notice-law">2.8.13.2</a> — and it's not a problem unique to <i>electronic</i> messages, of course.)
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Mandatory delivery methods might open the door to gamesmanship. EXAMPLE: A colleague once told of receiving a notice, <i>by FedEx</i>, from another party to a contract.  My colleague checked with in-house counsel at her (giant) company. The in-house counsel said, "We're going to ignore this notice, because the contract requires the notice to be <i>mailed</i>, and this one wasn't." Um &#x2026; that's &#x2026; not how things should work in a cooperative relationship — and courts generally won't go along with such game-playing except in limited circumstances; see the commentary at <a href="#notice-rcv-cmt">2.8.13.5</a>.

<p>
PARTIES: Follow any instructions in the Con&shy;tract about whether anyone else is to get a separately-sent copy of notices, e.g., a copy to legal counsel.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org4a0ef5f">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Copying the notified party's legal counsel on notices can be useful: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>disputes can sometimes be resolved quickly if legal counsel are brought in sooner rather than later; and</li>

<li>the redundant "path" of sending a separate copy to legal counsel can help make sure that the notice gets through.</li>
</ul>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Some drafters like to specify that a copy to legal counsel "shall not constitute notice." I'm on the fence whether that's a good idea — it might vary with the type of contract.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> If a party A doesn't know the name or address of party B's legal counsel, one way for A to send a copy of a notice to legal counsel would be to send a separate, <i>paper</i> copy of the notice <i>to B</i>, by certified mail or courier, specifically marked as, "Attention: Legal Counsel"; that way, the attention line <i>should</i> get the attention of <i>B</i>'s mailroom personnel and help them route it accordingly.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> If a party wants to <i>require</i> a copy of a notice to be sent to a particular legal counsel, that party should consider specifying in the requirement that the copy to counsel must be sent separately, to provide an independent delivery path and thus reduce the likelihood of nondelivery.

A.&nbsp; Alternative: "A party desiring to change its address for notice must do so <i>by</i> notice."  This alternative, though, might be a bad idea, because it could lead to problems if a notices clause (1) required all notices to be sent by, for example, certified mail; and (2) <i>required</i> changes of address to be communicated in that way. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> Contracting parties should be diligent about updating their address-for-notice records when they're told that another contracting party has changed its address.

<h6 id="org5fe3115">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org5fe3115">
<p>
A.&nbsp; This Protocol normally doesn't use the Mailbox Rule because the "Three Rs of Notice" approach in § <a href="#notice-3r">2.8.9</a> is a better fit for modern business practice. As a particular case, the third R — reasonable but unsuccessful attempts to deliver notice — handles the case where an addressee tries to evade notice.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; What <i>is</i> the Mailbox Rule, exactly? A Texas appeals court explained the rule:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When a letter, properly addressed and postage prepaid, is mailed, there exists a presumption the notice was duly received by the addressee. <b>This presumption may be rebutted by proof of non-receipt</b>. In the absence of proof to the contrary, the presumption has the force of a rule of law. <cite> <a href="https://cases.justia.com/texas/fifth-court-of-appeals/2015-05-14-00652-cv.pdf">Stuart v. U.S. Nat'l Bank Ass'n</a>, No. 05-14-00652-CV, slip op. at 4 (Tex. App. Dallas Oct. 28, 2015) (affirming home foreclosure) (cleaned up, emphasis added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Mailbox Rule's presumption of receipt might even be imposed by statute. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0260/chapter_0010/part_0060/section_0020/0260-0010-0060-0020.html">Mont. Code. Ann. 26-1-602</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
But as noted by the Third Circuit, "unsupported, second-hand accounts <i>[of mailing]</i> cannot invoke the mailbox rule's presumption." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11003527948579123867">Guerra v. Consolid. Rail Corp.</a>, 936 F.3d 124, 137 (3d Cir. 2019) (affirming dismissal of plaintiff's complaint). </cite>
</p>

<p>
In a different case, the Seventh Circuit elaborated:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In resolving a motion to compel arbitration, a court may apply the mailbox rule as a matter of law <b>only</b> where there exists no genuine dispute of material fact that the relevant communication was sent. 
</p>

<p>
* * *
</p>

<p>
Under Illinois law, however, even where the presumption is triggered, if the intended recipient denies receipt, that denial rebuts the presumption. Whether the communication was in fact received must then be decided by a trier of fact.  <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14452953365097759458">Kass v. PayPal Inc.</a>, 75 F. 4th 693, 703, 704 (7th Cir. 2023) (vacating and remanding order confirming arbitration award) (formatting modified). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
C.&nbsp; But why not just <i>always</i> use the "Mailbox Rule"? For <b>business-to-business</b> contracts, when it comes to whether a particular notice has in fact been received, "that's a conversation we don't want to have" (to paraphrase one of my former students in another context).
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Third Circuit once observed:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In this age of computerized communications and handheld devices, <b>it is certainly not expecting too much to require businesses</b> that wish to avoid a material dispute about the receipt of a letter <b>to use some form of mailing that includes verifiable receipt</b> when mailing something as important as a legally mandated notice.
</p>

<p>
The <b>negligible cost and inconvenience</b> of doing so is <b>dwarfed</b> by the practical consequences and potential unfairness of simply relying on business practices in the sender's mailroom.   <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7026220226065811743">Lupyan v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc.</a>, 761 F.3d 314, 322 (3d Cir. 2014) (emphasis and extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
D.&nbsp; But for <b>business-to-consumer</b> ("B2C") contracts, the business might want to use the Mailbox Rule to provide that notices <i>from the business</i> are effective a certain number of days after mailing; that's likely to be the most cost-effective approach for such situations.
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp;   <b>Pro tip:</b> Drafters might want to adjust the <i>time</i> at which notice becomes effective under the Mailbox Rule, so as to match the expected postal delivery time — especially if the notice will be mailed from one country to another.

It's not a good idea to impose overly-rigid notice requirements; consider what the circumstances might be when notice is appropriate — for example, less formality might well be appropriate when a party is notifying another of a safety issue.  
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Texas case (which had a noteworthy final result on appeal):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A  jury found that a contractor was given sufficient <i>oral</i> notice of serious safety violations, and that the customer had substantially (but not completely) complied with the contract's requirement that the customer give multiple <i>written</i> notices before being entitled to terminate the contract.</li>

<li>Based on the jury verdict, the trial court awarded the customer some $4 million in damages and attorney fees; an intermediate appeals court affirmed that judgment.</li>

<li>But the state supreme court reversed, holding that, because the contract specifically required three <i>written</i> notices, the contractor's actions were not enough. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11478440640996054979">James Constr.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-notice-law">
<p>
A.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> By law, some types of contract might require specific types of notice in particular situations and jurisdictions. EXAMPLE: An Alaska statute requires notices from an insurer to be sent either by first-class mail with a certificate from the USPS, or by electronic mail with electronic confirmation of receipt by the intended recipient. <cite> See <a href="https://www.akleg.gov/basis/statutes.asp#21.36.260">Alaska Stat. 21.36.260</a>, cited in <a href="https://cases.justia.com/alaska/supreme-court/2025-s-18828.pdf?ts=1751043633">Travelers Property Casualty</a> (Alaska 2025). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> While an exchange of text messages can form a binding contract (see <a href="#ts-bind">6.2</a>), parties should be judicious in sending notices <i>by text messages</i>, because text messages arguably have more potential to disappear than emails and FAXes. Tangentially, that's why California's Statute of Frauds requires written confirmation when texts and IMs are used to convey title to real property. <cite> See <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1624.">Cal.

<p>
For hard-copy notices, include the tracking number (certified mail, FedEx, etc.) <i>on the notice itself</i>. This can help forestall a claim by the addressee that the tracking number proved only that <i>some</i> document had been delivered and not necessarily the notice document.

<p>
DCT comment: As a brand-new lawyer, I saw the following occur in a state-court hearing on a motion for summary judgment:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The lawyer for the party opposing summary judgment claimed not to have received the 21-day advance notice of the motion hearing (required under state rules).</li>

<li>The lawyer for the party seeking summary judgment — me, filling in at the hearing for a colleague at my firm — showed the judge a "green card" certified-mail receipt from the U.S. Postal Service.</li>

<li>The opposing lawyer admitted to the judge that yes, the signature on the green card was that of his assistant — but the opposing lawyer insisted that the receipt must have been for some other communication because, he continued to insist, he had never received the 21-day notice <i>of the hearing</i>.</li>

<li>There was no documentation connecting <i>that particular</i> green-card receipt to the notice of the hearing.</li>

<li>The judge gave the benefit of the doubt to the opposing lawyer who claimed he never received the notice of the hearing.</li>

Some contract provisions require notice to be given no later than a specified time; a court might enforce such a requirement.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A longtime Pizza Inn franchisee had an option to renew the franchise term. The contract set a deadline for the franchisee to give notice that he wanted to exercise the option. The franchisee was two months late in giving his renewal notice, and Pizza Inn decided not to renew. The court ruled in favor of Pizza Inn, holding that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Under Texas law, the holder of an option must strictly comply with the terms of the option, which in this case included the deadline for the franchisee to give his renewal notice; and</li>

<li>In the particular circumstances, the franchisee's tardy renewal notice did not qualify for what the court described as a very-narrow "equitable intervention" exception to the law's general rule requiring strict compliance with option terms. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8762650802164301381">Pizza Inn, Inc. v.

If a notice is shown to have been actually received, a court is <i>likely</i> to consider the notice to have been effective, even if the contractual notice requirements were not strictly followed; see, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5873144412607476725">Elmen Holdings</a> (5th Cir. 2023). <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5873144412607476725">Elmen Holdings, L.L.C. v.

Suppose that two parties, "Alice" and "Bob," are entering into a contract, and that under the contract, Bob is supposed to notify Alice if a certain event occurs.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-sig-integ-trust">
<p>
Modern business continues to be based at least in part on trust: Many parties would be put off if they felt they had to re-read every word and punctuation mark in the final draft of a contract. 
</p>

<p>
But even so: A second-signing party might want <i>some</i> specific assurance that the first-signing party hadn't surreptitiously altered the agreed version(s); this Protocol helps to guard against such fraud.
</p>

<p>
(For "significant" contracts, of course it might still make sense to re-read the to-be-signed copy anyway, one last time, or at least to spot-check it.)
</p>

<p>
Granted, once a final version of a signature document has been agreed to, the overwhelming majority of lawyers and clients would never be so underhanded as to try to sneak in surreptitious changes. Doing so could damage a lawyer's reputation and possibly even lead to disciplinary action — and the client's <i>business</i> relationship with the other party might well be poisoned by surreptitious changes to an agreed final version of a document.
</p>

<p>
It's sad, though, that some signing parties have indeed surreptitiously changed signature documents; a few cases in point are discussed at <a href="#sig-fraud">2.9.3.2</a> below.

On occasion, a signer — or, more likely, an unscrupulous lawyer —  will try to be sneaky:
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In Iowa, a husband and wife agreed to a mediated settlement of a divorce case. The wife's lawyer drafted an agreement and sent it to the husband's lawyer — who surreptitously added a provision giving his client certain additional child-custody rights — and it was the (surreptitiously) modified agreement that was signed. When this came to light, the husband's lawyer's license to practice law was suspended indefinitely (for that plus other offenses), with no possibility of reinstatement for at least two years. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13496211421429152156">Att'y Discipl.

Dayton-Hudson</a>, 775 F.2d 757 (6th Cir. 1985). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: I once served as an expert witness for a company in the summary-judgment phase of a noncompetition lawsuit. Omitting some details: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A longtime executive at the company surreptitiously altered the HR department's draft of a modified employment agreement that he was being asked to sign.</li>

<li>In the electronic document, the executive changed a two-<i>year</i> post-employment noncompetition covenant to a two-<i>month</i> covenant.  He didn't flag <i>that</i> change — even though he <i>did</i> flag other changes in a different part of the 25-page document. (The executive's previous employment agreement had included a two-<i>year</i> noncompete.)  <i>The executive did this a second time</i> with a revised draft with agreed changes (!).</li>

<li>In due course, the executive resigned from the company. He took his wife on a two-<i>month</i> European vacation. Upon his return, he started working for a competitor of his former company.</li>

<li>The company sued the executive for, among other things, breach of the noncompete clause in his employment agreement.</li>

<li>The executive moved for summary judgment dismissing the company's claim, on grounds that his putative two-<i>month</i> noncompete had expired, and that the company should have re-read the agreement version that the <i>executive</i> signed before the <i>company</i> countersigned it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court denied the executive's summary-judgment motion. The case settled soon afterwards.
</p>

<p>
(Some "inside baseball" for litigators: For the company's summary judgment response, I provided a written expert witness affidavit about how things commonly work in the <i>business</i> world when parties negotiate contract wording. My affidavit focused on common <i>business</i> practice in contract negotiation, <b>not</b> the law. That's because courts generally don't allow lawyers to testify as expert witnesses at trial about <i>the law</i>, as instructing the jury about the law is the exclusive province of <i>the judge</i>.)

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: On a lighter note: An Australian landlord could have used a redlining representation in its lease form: As a prank, a prospective tenant, reviewing the lease in electronic form, added a requirement that the landlord must provide birthday cake on the weekend nearest the tenant's birthday. The landlord didn't notice the insertion. <cite> See Ricky Raad, <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/australia/landlord-tenant--leases/483576/tenant39s-additional-clause-takes-the-cake">Tenant's additional clause takes the cake</a> (Mondaq.com 2016). </cite>

<div id="outline-container-sig-integ-repr" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="sig-integ-repr"><span class="section-number-5">2.9.3.4.</span> This Protocol provides a document-integrity <i>representation</i> (not a warranty).</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-sig-integ-repr">
<p>
This Protocol is worded as a <a href="#cnfrm-defn">confirmation</a> — that is, a representation — as opposed to a <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">warranty</a>, about signature-document integrity.  That's intentional; here's why:
</p>

<p>
A.&nbsp; At the end of a fiscal quarter, a lot of contracts are likely to be in progress at once. (That's especially true in supplier-customer dealings.) Negotiators' time is a scarce resource; it has to be used economically. 
</p>

<p>
Each party wants a reasonable amount of legal protection, of course. But as the shot clock runs down on the quarter, each party <i>also</i> wants to try to timely get ink on the signature lines.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Moreover, suppose that you're representing a supplier: The <i>customer’s</i> contract negotiator might not be a lawyer — and the last thing your <i>sales</i> people want is for the customer's negotiator to get nervous about the supplier's language take the path of least resistance, and simply put off signing the deal.  A "confirmation" will likely comes across as softer than a warranty, and so might be less likely to trigger a visceral objection from the customer's people.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; To be sure, as the equivalent of a <i>representation</i>, a confirmation would have different legal consequences than a <i>warranty</i>. But in many supplier-customer situations — particularly longer-term, high-dollar relationships such as major supply contracts and some software license agreements — the differences likely will be academic:  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High-dollar suppliers are keenly interested in preserving their customer relationships if at all possible — they generally don’t want to file a lawsuit against a customer except as a last resort.</li>

<li>Customers like to have relationships with reliable suppliers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
D.&nbsp; So, if either party were <i>unintentionally</i> to make a material change in the contract without marking it, the odds are high that the parties would try to work things out amicably.
</p>

<p>
In that situation, the mere existence of this representation clause would bestow a fair degree of moral- and bargaining leverage on the other party. 
</p>

<p>
(It’s something that the other party's lawyer could go to his- or her counterpart with and ask, "can’t we do something about this?")
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Whether the change in the contract was truly unintentional might well come down to witnesses' credibility.  That would not be a comfortable situation for the party that had made the undisclosed change: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If a jury were to conclude that the party had <i>intentionally</i> sneaked in a material unmarked change in the contract, that likely would be fraud — giving rise among other things to the possibility of punitive damages.</li>

<li>That likely would give the innocent party even more bargaining power in negotiations to fix the contract wording.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sig-integ-red" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="sig-integ-red"><span class="section-number-5">2.9.3.5.</span> Red flag if a party doesn't want to agree to this Protocol?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-sig-integ-red">
<p>
<b>Caution:</b> If a party objects to including this Protocol in a contract, it might well be something of a "red flag," possibly indicating that the objecting party <i>might</i> not be a good business partner.
</p>

<p>
The objecting party might be saying, in effect: <i>We don't mind having to re-read the entire document you signed before</i> we <i>sign it to make sure you're not trying to cheat us — and we think</i> you <i>should have to do the same, to be sure</i> we're <i>not trying to cheat you</i>.
</p>

<p>
And at best, the other side doesn't mind wasting everyone's time and money on re-reading something that shouldn't have to be re-read. <i>At worst,</i> the other side really does think it's OK to slip in surreptitious changes.
</p>

<p>
This has happened to me only twice that I can recall: A pretty-junior associate in a law firm, representing a counterparty in a contract negotiation, objected to a similar clause. I contacted the associate's supervising partner, who'd also been working on the deal with us — and who quickly overruled the associate, saying, "Oh no, <i>of course</i> we'll agree to this." 
</p>

<p>
(The other time this happened, a different BigLaw firm was representing The Other Side: A partner in the firm simply rejected the signature-integrity clause, without explanation. My client wanted to make the deal happen, so I double-checked the final signed version — because I didn't trust the other side — and explained the situation to my client.)

A.&nbsp; Many contracts are signed electronically by geographically-separated parties. For that reason, signature pages are sometimes delivered "into <a href="#nl-escrow-nts">escrow</a>," to be held by attorneys until specified events occur, such as payment. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/24-2794/24-2794-2025-12-23.html">37celsius Capital Partners, L.P. v.

Dec. 23, 2025) (affirming summary judgment in favor of Intel) (signature pages for agreement to sell Intel subsiciary held in escrow until buyer 37celsius came up with purchase price — which never did happen). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Signature-page escrow typically involves an attorney for <i>A</i> sending <i>A</i>'s signed signature page to an attorney for <i>B</i>, who then holds the signed page it "in escrow" pending some specified event, such as <i>A</i>'s receipt of payment or of <i>B</i>'s own signed signature page. <cite> For more information, see, e.g., Anshu Pasricha and Thomas B. Romer, <a href="https://businesslawtoday.org/2022/02/mac-digital-documentation-protocol-best-practices-to-effect-esignings-closings-ma/">The MAC Digital Documentation Protocol: Best Practices to Effect eSignings and Closings for M&A</a> (BusinessLawToday.org 2022) (a project of the ABA Business Law Section Mergers & Acquisitions Committee, Technology in M&A Subcommittee) (scan down to "Principle 3"). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Fairly-elaborate signature escrow provisions such as <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403431/000095013708003369/c15909a7exv10w41.htm">this one</a> can be found at the <a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/signature-page-escrow-agreement">LawInsider.com site</a> — although these are likely to be overkill in many situations.

<p>
C.&nbsp; EXAMPLE: Here's an actual (anonymized) "signatures into escrow" email from a corporate acquisition deal in which I represented the seller:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="orge42eaf8">
<p>
D.C.,
</p>

<p>
Attached are [Buyer's] signature pages to be held in escrow pending their express release by our client at Closing.
</p>

<p>
[Buyer's counsel's name]
</p>

</div>

<p>
In this particular case, Buyer's counsel later released Buyer's signature pages from escrow with an <i>oral</i> statement, saying so on a Zoom call. (To be on the safe side, I confirmed the release in an email to Buyer's counsel.)  Buyer then sent the wire transfer for the purchase price.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-r-third-ben">
<p>
American law allows third parties to assert rights as "third-party beneficiaries" of a contract — <b>if</b> the signatory parties <b>intended</b> for that to be the case; see generally, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_beneficiary">Third-Party Beneficiary</a> (Wikipedia.org). For that reason, it's useful to be clear about the parties intent.

<p>
No party intends for any other individual or organization (each, a "person") to benefit under the Con&shy;tract except incidentally — and thus no other person is meant to have any enforceable rights under the Con&shy;tract — unless the Con&shy;tract expressly says so.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-r-third-ben-diff">
<p>
"Incidental" third-party beneficiaries under a contract are different from "intended" third-party beneficiaries — the former can't expect to be able to sue successfully a signatory party for breach of the contract.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In its 2016 <i>Lubrizol</i> opinion, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a summary judgment in favor of an additive supplier that had been sued by a <i>distributor's</i> end-customer — i.e., by the supplier's <i>customer's</i> customer. The court noted that the <i>end</i>-customer was <span class="underline">not</span> an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the supplier and the distributor; "[o]therwise a consumer would be a third-party beneficiary of <b>any</b> sales contract between a supplier of a good and a distributor of the good to the consumer." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10646748651050966676">Am.

<p>
Inconsistency about third-party beneficiaries can lead to litigation. EXAMPLE: In the aftermath of a sale of eight hospitals, an affiliate of the seller claimed to be an intended beneficiary of an indemnity provision in the parties' contract; in 2020 the Delaware chancery court denied the buyer's motion to dismiss the indemnity claim on grounds that the contract in question was ambiguous whether the indemnity provision was negated by a disclaimer of third-party beneficiaries. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10497042845433982467">CHS/Community Health Sys., Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-third-pty-other">
<p>
&#x2013;  A contract <b>might provide</b> that third-party benefits are <b>not assignable</b> (<a href="#AssmtThirdPtyBenefitsNotAssignable">17.3.6.5</a>).
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Third-party beneficiaries <b>might have to arbitrate</b> contract-related disputes if the contract contains an arbitration provision (<a href="#nl-ArbNonSig">23.1.33.18</a>).
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  An IP licensee's contractor or supplier might be a third-party beneficiary of the license's grant of permission to use the IP in question (<a href="#arc-cop-have-used">11.1.14</a>).
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  A contract between "Alice" and "Bob" might require that Alice's <i>subcontractors</i> enter into written agreements with Alice that explicit name Bob as a third-party beneficiary (<a href="#chan-subk">15.15.30</a>).

<p>
A.&nbsp; Many contracts are drafted by one party to state that one or both parties "acknowledges" something or another. That generally has a specific legal effect, recapped in this Protocol.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> If you sign a contract with an "acknowledgement" in it, you might be making a significant concession that could bite you later; see <a href="#ack-jerk">28.1.6</a> for discussion.

If a party <i>A</i> to the Con&shy;tract certifies a statement, whether in the Con&shy;tract or in a related document, <b>then unless</b> the certification clearly states otherwise, <i>A</i> is doing the following things for the benefit of each other party to the Con&shy;tract <i>B</i>:

A.&nbsp; Subdivision 1 and 2: See the discussion of representations and warranties (and the difference between them) at <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">18.2</a>. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 3 is to give other parties to the Con&shy;tract some comfort that the certifying party actually knows what it's talking about in making the certification.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 4 is included because a party alleging misrepresentation must usually <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">prove</a> (among other things) that the party relied on the <a href="#r-rep-defn">representation</a> <i>and</i> that its reliance was reasonable; this subdivision makes both of these things clear.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Upside: When you're the certifying party, a certification requirement can:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>give you an incentive to do a good job in complying with the relevant contract obligations; and</li>

<li>help you to identify specific areas that might need attention before a dispute arose — and thus possibly help to avoid the dispute in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Downside: Your certification would give the other party ammunition with which to blast you with a "<a href="#RelDisclBkgd">they lied</a>!" accusation, if it were to turn out that you'd overlooked something and thus your certification was incomplete or inaccurate.
</p>

<p>
(See <a href="#RelDisclBkgd">22.34.6.7</a> for more about how trial lawyers like to use "they lied!" in litigation, because non-expert judges and jurors will understand lying, whereas they might or might not fully understand the merits.)

</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>deception in any form, including but not limited to spoofing, for example, disguising the origin of any transmission sent via the Host System or any network associated with it;</li>

<li><a id="org6f00a70"></a> defamation — commonly understood as including libel (written defamation) and slander (oral defamation);</li>

<li>illegal activity, including but not limited to deployment of ransomware and other theft;</li>

<li>infringement of others' rights, including but not limited to use or reproduction of information or other content owned by someone else without the owner's permission;</li>

<li><a id="org806a7cd"></a> invasion of privacy, including but not limited to doxxing, that is, publicly identifying or publishing private information about (someone) especially as a form of punishment or revenge (see <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dox">Merriam-Webster.com</a>);</li>

<li>knowing or reckless introduction of malware, including but not limited to bots, corrupted files, crawlers, hoaxes, keystroke recorders, ransomware, Trojan horses, and viruses;</li>

<li>nuisiance, including but not limited to use in any manner that, in the Host's judgment, unreasonably burdened the Host System, any network associated with it, or any other network associated with the Host — this could include, for example (but not as a limitation), bandwidth usage that the Host judged to be excessive;</li>

<li>obscenity according to the standards in the geographic community where the User accessed the Host System;</li>

<li>unsolicited bulk email creation, transmission, and/or use — this particular prohibition is intended to encompass, without limitation, junk mail, "spam," and multi-level marketing ("MLM") solicitations; and/or</li>

<li>violation of any other acceptable-usage policy that the Host might publish from time to time — the Host would of course have to give the User and/or the Accessing Party reasonable notice if it did publish such a policy;</li>

<li>allowing anyone else to use the User's access credentials to access the Host System;</li>

<li>using someone else's credentials to access the Host System;</li>

<li>impersonating someone else in connection with the Host System;</li>

<li>establishing multiple user accounts to engage in one or more prohibited&#x2011; or restricted activities;</li>

<li>falsely pretending to <i>represent</i> another individual or entity in connection with the Host System;</li>

<li>accessing anyone else's information stored on the Host System without proper authorization;</li>

<li>tracing any information about, or owned by, any other user of the Host System — this would include, without limitation, personal identifying information and financial information of other users;</li>

<li>interfering with anyone else's use of the Host System;</li>

<li>selling or leasing access to the Host System;</li>

<li>probing or attempt to defeat or bypass security measures, access-control filters or -blocks, or other mechanisms built into the Host System to enforce limitations such as (for example) time, geography, etc.;</li>

<li><a id="orgd700db9"></a> making, distributing copies of, or creating derivative works based on, any content, data, or other information provided via the Host System, other than: (i) the Accessing Party's own content, or (ii) as expressly authorized in writing by the Host or other owner of the content;</li>

<li>otherwise infringing anyone else’s copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right in the course of using the Host System;</li>

<li>disassembling, decompiling, or otherwise reverse-engineering any aspect of the System;</li>

<li><a id="orgb953e8b"></a> use of a bot, screen scraper, Web crawler, or similar method to access the Host System or any content stored at the Host System, or otherwise accessing the Host System using any method other than the user interface provided by the Host;</li>

<li>use of the Host System for high-risk activities — such as, without limitation, the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, life-support systems, and/or the sole delivery of emergency communications — where the use, or failure, of the Host System could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (<b>unless</b> the Con&shy;tract clearly provides otherwise);</li>

<li>attempting to do something prohibited by the Con&shy;tract, whether or not the attempt is successful;</li>

Sometimes it might be reasonable for a Reviewer to want more information before deciding whether to consent to a proposed Action — granted, this "deferral is OK" language is vague enough to be potentially problematic. But it'd give the Proposer of the Action an incentive to cooperate with the Reviewer. EXAMPLE: The Eleventh Circuit upheld a patent owner's refusal to consent to a licensee's assignment of an exclusive license agreement, in part because the patent owner had asked the licensee for documentation about the proposed assignment transaction, but the licensee didn't comply with the request. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12210349750278162391">MDS (Canada) Inc. v.

<p>
Suppose that Alice is negotiating a contract with Bob, and Bob wants Alice to agree to ask Bob for consent before Alice takes some specified action. In that situation, Alice might be tempted to try to add a requirement that Bob's consent "must not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned."  
</p>

<p>
But that might cause more problems that it solves:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  For <i>assignment</i>-consent requests, a consent requirement might be implied <i>by law</i> in certain circumstances, whether or not <i>the contract</i> requires consent — still, some reviewing-party drafters like to impose an explicit consent requirement as <a href="#nl-ch-ins">cheap insurance</a>. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;   "Not to be unreasonably withheld" might not be worth much: If Bob wants to cause trouble for Alice, he could hem and haw about his consent, or ask for concessions. The resulting delay and expense could impede — and even kill — Alice's prospects for doing whatever it was that she asked Bob to consent to.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Now suppose that Alice has less bargaining power than Bob: If Alice asks Bob for a "not to be unreasonably withheld" qualifier, she might <a href="#poke-bear">poke the bear</a>: Bob might respond by demanding to change the consent requirement so that Bob has the right to grant or withhold his consent in his sole discretion.

<h5 id="cons-law"><span class="section-number-5">3.3.11.3.</span> The law might limit consent refusal</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-cons-law">
<p>
<b>Example:</b> <a href="http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/1995.260.html">Section 1995.260</a> of the California Civil Code provides that: "If a restriction on transfer of <b>the tenant's interest in a lease</b> requires the landlord's consent for transfer but provides no standard for giving or withholding consent, the restriction on transfer shall be construed to include an implied standard that the landlord's consent may not be unreasonably withheld. &#x2026; " 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Apropos of that statutory provision, a California appeals court held that a contract provision allowing the landlord to withhold consent "for any reason or no reason" was not to be construed as including an unreasonably-withheld standard, saying that "the parties' express agreement to a ‘sole discretion' standard is permitted under legal standards existing before and after enactment of section 1995.260, as long as the provision is freely negotiated and not illegal." <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5975088459473960721">Nevada Atlantic Corp. v. Wrec Lido Venture, LLC</a>, No. G039825 (Cal. App. Dec. 8, 2008) (unpublished; reversing trial-court judgment that withholding of consent was unreasonable).
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In an Oregon case, A lease prohibited the tenant from assigning the agreement, including by operation of law, without the landlord's consent. The lease also stated that the landlord would not unreasonably withhold its consent to an assignment of the lease <i>to a subtenant that met certain qualifications</i>. Notably, though, the lease did <i>not</i> include a similar, no-unreasonable-withholding statement for <i>other</i> assignments. Oregon's supreme court held that ordinarily, the state's law <b>would have</b> required the landlord to act in good faith in deciding whether or not to consent to an assignment. <b>But</b>, the court said, the parties had <i>implicitly</i> agreed otherwise — therefore, the landlord did <i>not</i> have such a duty of good faith. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7064392015529436400">Pacific First Bank v. New Morgan Park Corp.</a>, 876 P.2d 761 (Or. 1994) (affirming court of appeals decision on different grounds, and reversing trial-court declaration that bank-tenant had not <i>materially</i> breached lease). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12210349750278162391">MDS (Canada)</a> (11th Cir. 2013), the court upheld a trial court's finding that the owner of a patent, which had exclusively licensed the patent to another party, had <i>not</i> acted <i>unreasonably</i> under the circumstances when it refused consent to an assignment by the licensee to a party that wanted to acquire the licensee's relevant product line.
</p>

<p>
(This holding provides a useful illustration of how appeals courts have only a limited ability to "second-guess" a trial court's findings of fact.)
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In 2013's <i>Dick Broadcasting Co.</i>, Tennessee's supreme court held that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
where the parties have contracted to allow assignment of an agreement with the consent of the non-assigning party, 
</p>

<p>
and the agreement is silent regarding the anticipated standard of conduct in withholding consent, 
</p>

<p>
[then] an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing applies and requires the nonassigning party to act[:]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>with good faith</li>
<li>and in a commercially reasonable manner</li>
</ul>

<p>
in deciding whether to consent to the assignment.  <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17013430440177580551">Dick Broadcasting Co. v. Oak Ridge FM, Inc.</a>, 395 S.W.3d 653, 656-57 (Tenn. 2013) (affirming vacation of summary judgment and remand to district court) (formatting revised). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Alabama's supreme court alluded to a similar possibility; The contract in suit specifically gave the Shoney's restauraunt chain the right, <i>in its sole discretion</i>, to consent to any proposed assignment or sublease of a ground lease by a real-estate developer that had acquired the ground lease from Shoney's. The supreme court held that this express language overrode a rule that had been laid down in prior case law, namely that a refusal to consent is to be judged by a reasonableness standard under an implied covenant of good faith. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14754343401549936655">Shoney's LLC v. MAC East, LLC</a>, 27 So.3d 1216, 1220-21 (Ala. 2009) (on certification by Eleventh Circuit). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> The Texas supreme court declined to read a reasonableness requirement into an assignment-consent provision. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=472849420318702928">Barrow-Shaver Resources Co. v. Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc.</a>, 590 S.W.3d 471, 476 (Tex. 2019) (affirming court of appeals and declining to read a reasonableness qualifier into a consent-to-assign provision). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution</b> for Texas lawyers and law students: <i>Barrow-Shaver</i> fits in with Texas's non-recognition of a <i>general</i> implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16602806731795093132">Subaru of America, Inc. v. David McDavid Nissan, Inc.</a>, 84 S.W.3d 212 (Tex. 2002); see also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=223299724094247887">Hux v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-cons-gen-cmt">
<p>
Suppose that you're drafting a contract <span class="underline">form</span> that your client Alice expects to use with lots of other parties — Bob, Betty, Billy, and so on.

That's because:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  If Alice ever <i>did</i> want to take Action X, she'd need to seek the consent of <i>all</i> of the various other parties with which she has used the contract form.

<p>
&#x2013;  Even seeking such consent could be burdensome and costly, as discussed at <a href="#AssmtConsentBurdenCmt">17.3.7.11</a>.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-empl-prot-oracle">
<p>
EXAMPLE: In 2014, the state of Oregon filed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141014060142/https://www.oregon.gov/docs/082214_filing.pdf">a $3 billion lawsuit</a> against Oracle Corporation <i>and six Oracle employees personally</i>, in the wake of the failed attempt to develop Oregon's health-insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act a.k.a. Obamacare.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The six employees sued included five executives at the vice-president level and higher — <i>as well as a technical manager</i> who was accused of having conducted a fraudulent demo of the new system's capabilities.</li>

<li>The state sought "only" some $45 million from the technical manager, as well as amounts ranging from $87 million to $267 million from various Oracle executives.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To be sure, high-profile lawsuits like this typically settle before trial. Not least, this is because the elected officials who bring or authorize the lawsuits would prefer to trumpet a "victory" instead of rolling the dice with the court. 
</p>

<p>
And sure enough, Oregon's lawsuit against Oracle was <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2016/09/post_183.html">settled</a> — Oracle agreed to pay Oregon $25 million in cash and provide the state with another $75 million in technology.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Such cases don't always settle: The state of Indiana sued IBM for allegedly botching the building of a new system for administering the state's welfare programs. That lawsuit dragged on for nearly ten years and ended (more or less) with a judgment against IBM for some $78 million. (In that case, the government apparently didn't sue individual IBM personnel.) <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7430114161307512070">Indiana v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-empl-prot-perdue">
<p>
EXAMPLE: A truck driver, making a chemical delivery to a Perdue Farms poultry-processing plant, told the plant's gate guards (who worked for a security contractor) that he was delivering bleach. But the driver was seriously mistaken: The bill of lading said, correctly, that the delivery was of <a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/0057.pdf">aluminum chloride</a>, a corrosive hazardous.
</p>

<p>
The gate guards didn't check the bill of lading; they told the driver to put the "bleach" in the bleach tank. The resulting <a href="https://researchsafety.northwestern.edu/docs/chemical-incompatibility-with-bleach-print-2019.pdf">chemical reaction</a> caused significant damage to the facility: "Fog and foam erupted from the tank into the plant, filling multiple rooms and damaging equipment. Perdue had to shut down its plant for 'multiple days' to clean the plant and salvage its equipment."
</p>

<p>
Perdue sued the trucking company; the security company; <i>and the driver and three gate guards personally</i>. Perdue apparently did so to try to escape a forum-selection clause in the security-company's contract with Perdue, which designated the federal district court in Maryland — where Perdue was incorporated and had its headquarters — as the exclusive forum for any disputes relating to that contract.
</p>

<p>
The Indiana supreme court would have none of it: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[W]e reject [Perdue's] strategic pleading to avoid the forum-selection clause <i>by suing the [security company's] Indiana-based employees individually</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Second, we decline to apply the forum-selection clause to the plaintiff's claims against the individual employees. These employees (unlike their employer) are not parties to the forum-selection clause, and they are not in privity with their employer. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18325622550974873457">Perdue Farms, Inc. v.

<h5 id="empl-non-rec-scope-cmt"><span class="section-number-5">3.5.5.4.</span> How much protection would this Protocol <i>really</i> provide?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-empl-non-rec-scope-cmt">
<p>
This Protocol would preclude <i>some</i> "fraudulent inducement" claims involving alleged fraudulent representations <i>outside</i> the contract — but <i>not</i>, perhaps, claims of "contractual fraud," i.e., "a knowingly false contractual representation &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15297027552286098158">AmeriMark Interactive, LLC v. AmeriMark Holdings, LLC</a>, No. N21C-12-175 MMJ CCLD, text acc. n.12 (Del. Supr. Ct. Nov. 3, 2022). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Nor would this Protocol likely  protect an individual against <i>tort</i>-based claims. The Texas supreme court explained: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Independent of the vicarious liability that may be imposed on corporate shareholders and officers based on veil-piercing theories, we have also long held that corporate agents are personally liable for their own fraudulent or tortious acts even though they were acting on behalf of the corporation. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6137439196225027052">Keyes v. Weller</a>, 692 S.W.3d 274, 279 (Tex. 2024) (cleaned up). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
The state supreme court affirmed reversal of a summary judgment that had dismissed fraud claims by two plaintiffs against two individual defendants; those defendants were members, and had acted as agents, of a limited liability company. The affirmance meant that the two individual defendants would have to return to the trial court and defend against the plaintiffs' fraud claims.
</p>

<p>
In another case, the Texas supreme court noted that "the fact that an individual was acting in a corporate capacity does not prevent the individual from being held personally liable for the harm caused by those <i>[tortious]</i> acts <i>[committed by the individual]</i>." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11246380411621584848">Transcor Astra Group S.A. v. Petrobras America Inc.</a>, 650 S.W.3d 462, 478-79 (Tex. 2022) (reversing court of appeals; reliance disclaimer in settlement agreement barred fraud claims). </cite>
</p>

<p>
But even so: To keep parties' employees out of the line of fire in disputes, contractual protective language, along the lines of this Protocol would certainly be better than nothing.

<h5 id="empl-non-recourse-atty"><span class="section-number-5">3.5.5.5.</span> Ethics note: <i>Should</i> a lawyer look out for the client's <i>employees</i>?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-empl-non-recourse-atty">
<p>
Let's assume that it's a lawyer who is drafting or reviewing a contract on behalf of an organization. The lawyer has no professional obligation to make sure that the company's employees are protected from <i>personal</i> liability. 
</p>

<p>
But it’s <i>normally</i> not a conflict of interest for the lawyer to simultaneously keep an eye out for the interests of clients' <i>employees</i> as well as for the interests of the client.  (See also <a href="#sigs-corp">4.12.3</a> for a similar point in the context of drafting contract signature blocks.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> A lawyer might find herself dealing with an employee of a client company in a situation where the interests of the employee and the company diverge or even conflict. One example might be an investigation of possible criminal conduct such as deceptive backdating of a contract, discussed at <a href="#bkdate-cmt-ca">5.1.9</a>.
</p>

<p>
Whenever that happens, the lawyer should consider whether she should affirmatively advise the employee, <i>preferably in writing</i>, that she’s not the <i>employee’s</i> lawyer and that the employee should consider engaging separate counsel — conceivably, the company's lawyer might even have an ethical obligation to do so.

Employers have been known to try to use confidentiality agreements (and confidentiality provisions in employment agreements and settlement agreements) to keep workers from speaking publicly about workplace condition or cooperating with law-enforcement authorities. But federal- and state government agencies often take the position that such agreements and provisions are unlawful. <cite> See Melissa Osipoff Camire and George A.

The Biden-era National Labor Relations Board took the position (along with some courts) that a contractual requirement of silence about workplace conditions — <i>and even proffering such requirements to employees</i> — violates section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, at <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/157">29 U.S.C. § 157</a>; in enforcing the specific decision, the Sixth Circuit declined to address the Board's position on that point. <cite> See <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/07-CA-263041">McLaren Macomb and Local 40 RN Staff Council, OPEIU</a>, 372 NLRB No. 58 (Feb. 21, 2023), <i>enforced</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5836063514598378170">NLRB v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-excl-sil-c">
<p>
A contract's silence about exclusivity could be interpreted as implicitly <i>denying</i> <b>or</b> <i>granting</i> exclusivity. 
</p>

<p>
For example: Suppose that a manufacturer and a distributor enter into an agreement for the distributor to carry one of the manucturer's products in a given territory. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>May the manufacturer grant similar rights to other distributors?</li>

<li>May the manufacturer engage in distribution activities itself? Or must the manufacturer work exclusively through the distributor?</li>

<li>Is the distributor's right exclusive <i>in that territory</i>? What about <i>for that particular product</i>?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Courts have gone both ways on those subjects:
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A Rhode Island company had a contract with the state to pick up human remains and transport them to the medical examiner’s office. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The contract said nothing about exclusivity.</li>

<li>To save money, the medical examiner’s office started having its own people pick up some of the remains; that cut into the company’s business.</li>

<li>The company sued the state, claiming that its remains pickup contract was exclusive — and thus (said the company) the ME’s office breached the contract by having its own people pick up remains.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The case went all the way to Rhode Island's supreme court — which affirmed a trial court's rejection of the company's exclusivity claim. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16666349977628850286">JPL Livery Services, Inc. v. Dept. of Admin.</a>, 88 A.3d 1134 (R.I. 2014). </cite>
</p>

<p>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: A contract between a manufacturer and a Wisconsin dealership was silent about whether <i>the dealer</i> had exclusive rights; that silence — plus the dealer's <i>de facto</i> exclusivity for many years — drew the parties into several years of presumably-expensive litigation in federal court, culminating in what amounted to a final judgment after a jury trial. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11553210448275849333">Kaeser Compressors, Inc. v. Compressor & Pump Repair Services, Inc.</a> 781 F. Supp. 2d 819 (E.D.

</p>

<p>
Similarly, a gravel-mining lease in Alaska was silent as to whether it was exclusive; the state's supreme court held that the lease was ambiguous about whether it was exclusive — and on remand, the trial court found that the lease was indeed exclusive. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6583173663892463272">AAA Valley Gravel, Inc. v. Totaro</a>, 219 P.3d 153, 160-61 (Alaska 2009) (vacating and remanding trial-court decision) (footnote omitted), <i>after remand</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3740667556472467769">325 P.3d 529</a> (Alaska 2014) (affirming trial-court judgment). </cite>

<p>
It should be obvious, but if a party commits to an <i>exclusive</i> deal with another party, the first party would be limiting its freedom to do business with others — even though that could turn out to be important in the future.  
</p>

<p>
For example: An exclusivity clause might weaken a party's future resiliency against adverse events such as the COVID&#x2011;19 pandemic, dockworker strikes, and the like: An uncooperative vendor might try to wield an exclusivity clause against a desperate customer seeking alternative sources of goods, even though the supplier might not be able to deliver. True, the customer might be able to invoke <a href="#r-fmaj">force majeure</a>, but that could be small comfort if it led to costly litigation with the supplier.

<p>
Violating an exclusivity clause can lead to serious consequences. EXAMPLE: In a New York case, e-commerce giant Amazon entered into a nonbinding letter of intent ("LOI") to negotiate a lease for space in a building on the Avenue of the Americas in New York City (the "Avenue building"). 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The LOI included an exclusivity clause prohibiting Amazon from negotiating for other local space during a stated exclusivity period.</li>

<li>But while Amazon and the Avenue building owner were negotiating the formal lease, Amazon not only secretly shopped elsewhere, it signed a lease for other space — leaving the Avenue building owner stuck with the cost of extensive renovations that Amazon had requested.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The trial court granted the Avenue building owner's motion for summary judgment that Amazon had breached the LOI. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=883747245371168509">DOLP 1133 Properties II LLC v.

</p>

<p>
There might well have been a "political" angle to the case — and in litigation, political considerations can indeed matter: Not even a year beforehand, Amazon had backed out on its highly-visible selection of the borough of Queens as the location of its planned second headquarters. This followed intense community backlash after the selection was announced, which was widely reported in the press. <cite> See, e.g., J. David Goodman, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html">Amazon Pulls Out of Planned New York City Headquarters</a>, N.Y.

A nonbinding LOI for a private-equity investment agreement included both a statement of the parties' intent to draft a definitive agreement <i>and</i> an exclusivity provision precluding the investment target from engaging with other prospective investors.

<li>Two parties, which we'll call "Alice" and "Bob" (following a practice in the tech world), are negotiating a contract.</li>

<li>A third party, "Carol," comes along to offer Alice a better deal.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that situation, Bob might try to claim that Alice had <i>implicitly</i> agreed to negotiate <i>exclusively</i> with Bob for some period of time. And that, perhaps, could result in Bob's suing <i>Carol</i> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interference#:~:text=Tortious%20interference%2C%20also%20known%20as,third%20party%2C%20causing%20economic%20harm.">tortious interference</a> with Bob's contract with Alice.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: That's approximately what happened in the legendary <i>Pennzoil v. Texaco</i> case, where in a Houston state-court trial, Pennzoil won a jury verdict of some $29 billion (in 2025 dollars) against Texaco for tortiously interfering with what the jury and the courts found to be a binding memorandum of understanding between Pennzoil and Getty Oil. The size of the verdict, and the state-law requirement that Texaco post a appeal bond of the same amount, eventually forced Texaco to file for bankruptcy protection. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11763000609638124594">Texaco, Inc. v.

In a 2024 federal-court case, a battery manufacturer terminated an exclusive distribution agreement for uncured breach by the distributor and sued the distributor for breach. The distributor counterclaimed, alleging (among other things) that the manufacturer had itself breached the agreement by lining up a replacement distributor before the effective date of termination. The court dismissed the counterclaim, holding:

First, the exclusivity clause did not survive the termination of the contract. &#x2026; Second, the plain language of the exclusivity clause does not prohibit C&D from <i>negotiating</i> with another party during the lifetime of the Agreement, nor does it prevent C&D from agreeing to enter into an agreement with a third party <i>after</i> the termination of the Agreement. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14067376638318663319">C&D Techs., Inc. v.

<p>
A.&nbsp; This section is a "no surprises" provision; it has in mind that: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="#nl-subk-cmt">subcontracts</a> to government contracts might include mandatory "[BROKEN LINK: flowdown-cmt]" obligations as a matter of law (concerning flowdowns, see the brief notes at § [BROKEN LINK: flowdown-cmt]); and</li>

<li>neither party wants to be surprised to learn that the Con&shy;tract includes such flowdown obligations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course, entire books have been written about government contracting and subcontracting. This Protocol aims merely to help parties spot any need to address issues that could arise in such contracts.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b> This disclaimer is limited to <i>government</i> subcontracting. That's because when you have a contract between parties A and B, party A might legitimately think that it's none of B's business whether the contract is a subcontract to another contract between A and some third party C.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 1.b of course doesn't preclude <i>B</i> from voluntarily providing such reports, etc; it might well be a good idea for the parties to talk about it.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Subdivision 1.a: The term <i>flowdown</i> can be relevant when a contract is between a customer and a so-called "prime" contractor that is expected to use <a href="#nl-subk-cmt">subcontractors</a>: Some such contracts require the prime contractor to "flow down" some of the prime contractor's obligations in all subcontracts, so that subcontractors will also be required to comply with those obligations — e.g., obligations concerning equal opportunity, safety, recordkeeping, conflicts of interest, anticorruption, and the like.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the law, a subcontractor could be subject to specific requirements imposed by statute or regulation, for example: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>equal-opportunity reporting requirements;</li>
<li>affirmative-action obligations;</li>
<li>prohibitions of various employment practices;</li>
<li>restrictions of various kinds, e.g., on <a href="#r-assmt-consent">assignments</a>;</li>
<li>requirements to keep various records.</li>
</ul>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Subdivision 1.a "riffs on" concepts in § 4.1.2 of a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1109879/000119312512355475/d396528dex101.htm">Cisco Indirect Channel Partner Agreement</a>.

A.&nbsp; Sometimes, party <i>B</i>'s <i>business</i> people might refuse to get <i>B</i>'s <i>lawyers</i> involved, or even to put party <i>A</i> in touch with <i>B</i>'s lawyers.

<p>
To help each party to deal with such situations, this Protocol gives <i>B</i> a bit of leverage: <i>A</i> can tell <i>B</i>'s business people, "<i>you do realize that by refusing to get your lawyer involved, you're in breach of contract for that alone, right?</i>"

<h6 id="org50fa3c1">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org50fa3c1">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: The context here is that, except in limited circumstances, <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_4_2_communication_with_person_represented_by_counsel/">ABA Model Rule 4.2</a> prohibits a lawyer from communicating directly with a party that the lawyer knows to be represented, in the matter in question, by another lawyer. <b>But:</b> This is clarified in <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/aba-formal-opinion-503.pdf">Formal Opinion 503</a>, issued in 2022 by an ABA standing committee on ethics; that opinion states that absent special circumstances, a "reply all" email is considered to have <i>implicit</i> consent.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; DCT note: To be sure: It's a bad thing for one party's lawyer to try to exert undue influence on another party by going behind the back of the other party's lawyer. <b>But</b>: In <i>commercial</i> transactions, it could slow up the parties' dealings if <i>B</i>'s lawyer insisted that <i>A</i>'s lawyer <i>not</i> copy <i>B</i>'s business people on emails. 
</p>

<p>
That once happened to me:  Another party's lawyer — a longtime sole practitioner — forbade me to open-copy his client on emails I sent to him, even when I was copying my own client on the email. He also refused to copy <i>my</i> client on <i>his</i> emails to me; that meant that I had to notice that my client hadn't been copied and then forward his emails to my client. Sheesh.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, that other lawyer originally sent his emails to me in encrypted form, which meant that I'd have had to create an account with some service I'd never heard of in order to get his emails decrypted. I put my foot down on that one, because it was indisputably overkill; he relented and sent his emails the usual way.

<h5 id="c-site-vis-examp"><span class="section-number-5">3.10.3.1.</span> Introduction: A hypothetical example</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-c-site-vis-examp">
<p>
Here's a hypothetical example of when the defense- and indemnity obligations of this Protocol would come into play: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Let's say that you enter into a contract with another party.</li>

<li>Now let's say that one of the other party's employees were to engage in unprofessional conduct — for example, harassment — that adversely affects one of your employees.</li>

<li>Subsequently, your harassed employee sues <i>you</i>, claiming that the other party's employee created a hostile work environment — and that <i>you're</i> legally liable.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This isn't an idle concern: The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment">has taken the position</a> that "The employer will be liable for harassment by non-supervisory employees <i>or non-employees over whom it has control</i> (e.g., independent contractors or customers on the premises), if it <i>knew, or should have known</i> about the harassment and <i>failed to take</i> prompt and appropriate corrective action." <cite> See also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9745063790470077906">EEOC v. Skanska USA Bldg., Inc.</a>, No. 12-5967, slip op. at part II.A (6th Cir. Dec. 10, 2013) (reversing summary judgment; general contractor that in fact controlled subcontractor's employees could be liable for race-based hostile work environment created by employees) (unpublished). </cite>
</p>

<p>
(At this writing, in February 2026, the above-cited EEOC Web page states that "The information on this webpage is being reviewed for compliance with the law <i>and [Trump] executive orders</i> and will be revised." [Emphasis added.] That's been the case for at least a year, since February 2025.)
</p>

<p>
In that situation, this Protocol requires the other party to defend and indemnify you against the claim by your employee.  
</p>

<p>
And the same would be true if you were being sued by an unrelated third party, and not by one of your own employees, for conduct by the other party's employee. That's a potential concern because the third party's lawyers might be very "creative" about legal theories with which to try to drag you into the litigation in the hope of getting you to pay some money to go away (i.e., to settle out).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-c-site-vis-examp-why" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="c-site-vis-examp-why"><span class="section-number-5">3.10.3.2.</span> Why bother with this Protocol?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-c-site-vis-examp-why">
<p>
The express <i>defense</i> reference in this Protocol has some business significance: Suppose (for example) that:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>one of the other party's employees allegedly broke the law as part of the Con&shy;tract, in a manner for which the other party was responsible under, say, the doctrine of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respondeat_superior">respondeat superior</a></i>; and</li>
<li><p>
as a result, a third party made a claim — civil, or criminal — against <i>you</i>.
</p>

<p>
If the other party didn't have an express defense obligation, such as that of this Protocol, then you'd likely have to "front" your own legal expenses, even though the other party's noncompliance with the law might constitute a breach of the Con&shy;tract if the Con&shy;tract required compliance. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6087841979524689726">Trone Health Services, Inc. v.

A.&nbsp; When a waiver is drafted too broadly, it can do serious damage to a party's position. EXAMPLE: This happened in a Delaware case, where an option grant to a company's consultant and board member allegedly stated that the grantee waived his right to two previous grants. The chancery court dismissed the consultant's lawsuit for failure to state a claim; reversing and remanding, the state supreme court ruled that ambiguity in the waiver language precluded dismissal at that stage:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Because we find that both parties have proffered reasonable interpretations of the Waiver, the agreement is ambiguous. The trial court cannot choose between two reasonable interpretations of an ambiguous contract in resolving a motion to dismiss. Dismissal is proper only if the moving party's interpretation is the only reasonable construction as a matter of law. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5386770435890190921">Terrell v.

Suppose that (1) you're drafting a contract or other document, and (2) in some particular provision, you want to say that <b>the other party</b> (or even your own client) "waives" something. In that situation, it's a good idea to use bold-faced, all-capital letters for the word "<b>WAIVES</b>" (or <i>waived</i>, or <i>waive</i>, or <i>waiver</i>) — doing so can be "<a href="#nl-ch-ins">cheap insurance</a>" to help persuade a judge, jury, or arbitrator, plus sometimes the applicable law might <i>require</i> waivers to be "<a href="#consp-cmt">conspicuous</a>."

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-waiv-confirm-c">
<p>
A.&nbsp; In any situation where you might later want to claim a <i>nonwritten</i> waiver by another party, seriously consider sending an email, to an appropriate person at the other party, <b>prominently</b> stating that the other party is indeed waiving the right or obligation. That way, if you later show that the person in fact received your email, and the other party didn't object within a reasonable time, then your email could: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>help discourage the other party from later denying the waiver, and</li>

<li>if necessary, help you prove the waiver to a court or arbitration tribunal.</li>
</ul>

<p>
B.&nbsp; In any such email, it's never a bad idea to try to put the ball in the other party's court to speak up, such as: <i>Hey, [OTHER PARTY], in our call today, thanks for agreeing that I don't need to do [whatever] — if I misunderstood you, please let me know immediately</i>.  
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> When sending a waiver-confirmation email like this, <b>Don't ask the other party to "agree"</b> that the other party waived something — that's because if the other party never responds to your email, then it'd be harder for you to prove the other party's oral waiver.  #MuscleMemory

<i>(Students, you can just skim this section.)</i>
</p>

<p>
Here's a business problem: Sometimes parties to a contract, in the course of their dealings will agree <i>orally</i> to modify the contract, or to waive a contract requirement. Of course, the parties <i>should</i> follow up with written documentation of the modification. But that doesn't always happen — even when the contract specifically requires such a writing. 
</p>

<p>
Even when a contract clearly says that amendments must be in writing, in litigation a party might claim that the parties <i>orally</i> agreed to <i>waive</i> that writing requirement.  
</p>


<p>
This doctrine is illustrated in a century-old New York precedent — for mnemonic purposes, we'll call it the "<b>Cardozo Rule</b>," after its author, later a Supreme Court justice — parties are free to <i>orally waive</i> a contractual requirement that amendments and waivers must be in writing, subject to any possible impact of the statute of frauds (see <a href="#stat-frauds">34.34</a>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Those who make a contract, may unmake it. 
</p>

<p>
The clause which forbids a change may be changed like any other. 
</p>

<p>
The prohibition of oral waiver, may itself be waived. 
</p>

<p>
Every such agreement is ended by the new one which contradicts it.
</p>

<p>
What is excluded by one act, is restored by another. 
</p>

<p>
Whenever two men <i>[sic]</i> contract, no limitation self-imposed can destroy their power to contract again <i>[to amend the first contract]</i>.
</p>

<p>
You may put it out by the door, it is back through the window.  <cite> <a href="https://casetext.com/case/beatty-v-guggenheim-exploration-co">Beatty v Guggenheim Exploration Co.</a>, 225 N.Y. 380, 387-88 (1919) (Cardozo, J.), <i>quoted in</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8191602377925876662">Israel v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-amend-writ-del">
<p>
A.&nbsp; In contract cases, <b>Delaware</b> law (grudgingly) allows a party to assert that the parties <i>orally</i> agreed to waive an amendments-in-writing requirement. (See the  discussion of the "<a href="#amend-writ-enf">Cardozo Rule</a>" at <a href="#amend-writ-enf">3.12.4.1</a>.) 
</p>

<p>
<b>But</b> Delaware law also says that the asserting party must meet a heightened evidentiary burden, because the state's law disfavors such assertions. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=110480">Tunney v. Hilliard</a>, No. 1317, letter op. at 14 & n.16 (Del. Ch.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <b>Massachusetts</b> law allows such claims; this was noted in a federal court opinion, which allowed a contractor's lawsuit over a purported equity grant to move forward, but with a veiled warning about the proof requirement:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
A provision that an agreement may not be amended orally but only by a written instrument does not necessarily bar oral modification of the contract. 
</p>

<p>
Whether an oral modification occurred <b>can be inferred</b> from the <b>conduct</b> of the parties and from the attendant <b>circumstances</b> of the case. The proponent of the oral modification must present <b>evidence of sufficient force to overcome the presumption</b> that the integrated and complete agreement, which requires written consent to modification, expresses the intent of the parties. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5163790394918367802">Hoffman v. Thras.io Inc.</a>, 538 F. Supp.3d 196, 206 (D. Mass. 2021) (denying relevant part of motion to dismiss, citing cases; cleaned up, emphasis and extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
Similarly, under <b>California law</b>, even if a contract does contain an amendments-in-writing requirement, a party can try to claim that the requirement was <i>orally</i> waived — but the party must specifically prove that the waiver happened.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a case out of Hollywood, the parties fought over how to share the profits from the TV series <i>Home Improvement</i>. Long story short: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An appeals court ruled that a jury must decide whether the Disney company had orally waived or agreed to modify an incontestability provision in the contract in suit — whether by words or by conduct.</li>

<li>But (said the court): The plaintiffs would still have to <i>specifically prove</i> that Disney had in fact waived the requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>
B.&nbsp; To be sure: It might seem strange to adopt a state's law for one specific provision in a contract.

In New York, the <a href="#amend-doc-juris-enforce">Cardozo Rule</a> has (largely) been <b>overruled by statute</b>; see <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/general-obligations-law/gob-sect-15-301.html">N.Y. General Obligations Law 15-301(1)</a>, which provides that: "A written agreement &#x2026; which contains a provision to the effect that it cannot be changed orally, cannot be changed by an executory agreement <i>unless</i> such executory agreement is in writing and signed[:] [i] by the party against whom enforcement of the change is sought or [ii] by his agent." (Emphasis and bracketed text added.) 
</p>

<p>
In some other U.S. jurisdictions, courts will likewise uphold contractual requirements that amendments and waivers must be in writing. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17559132620534848593">DeValk Lincoln Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.</a>, 811 F.2d 326, 334 & n.2 (7th Cir. 1987); to like effect, see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9790779032974242267">Ryan Companies U.S., Inc. v. FDP WTC, LLC</a>, No. 20-1366, slip op. (Iowa App. Jan. 12, 2022) (unpublished; reversing, in part, judgment awarding breach-of-contract damages to contractor). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The UK's Supreme Court once cited the Cardozo Rule but expressly <b>rejected</b> it. The court concluded that "the law should and does give effect to a contractual provision requiring specified formalities to be observed for a variation." <cite> <a href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/24.html">Rock Advert.

A good #MuscleMemory habit: <i>Any</i> written confirmation of a purported oral waiver is better than none. It's far, far better to confirm an amendment to the Con&shy;tract — even with a minimalist writing such as an email exchange or even just an unanswered text — than to rely on fallible human memory.

The term "<b>good faith</b>" refers to conduct that: (1) is honest in fact; and (2) comports with reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Contract drafters sometimes explicitly set out <i>good faith</i> as a standard of performance of conduct. But as the Supreme Court observed in <i>Northwest, Inc.</i> (2014), "it does not appear that there is any uniform understanding of the doctrine's precise meaning." This means that agreeing to a good-faith standard could set the stage for costly litigation in the future.

<li>When this Protocol is agreed to: By entering into the Con&shy;tract, you're <a href="#cnfrm-defn">confirming</a> to each other party that — so far as you're then aware — you've disclosed to the other party any instance in which:

A.&nbsp; This Protocol provides a "canary in the coal mine" to help the parties identify (and, ideally, address) certain problems <i>before</i> they sign the Con&shy;tract. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Some strategically-important types of agreement include more-detailed representations <i>and</i> warranties of this general kind — see, for example, the (pretty-typical) reps and warranties in the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/UAL-CAL">merger agreement</a> between United Airlines and Continental Airlines, from which some of the concepts in this Option are drawn.

C.&nbsp; The statements in this Protocol are <i>representations</i>, not warranties; see generally <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">18.2</a> for a discussion of the differences. 
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Subdivision 1.b: As an example: One possible problematic claim would be that a party's performance under the Con&shy;tract would constitute tortious interference, on the part of any party to the Con&shy;tract:

Aggressive lawyers, for a variety of self-interested reasons — notably, wanting to please their clients by telling the clients what they (the clients) want to hear  — will sometimes try to argue that a contract provision doesn't <i>really</i> mean what it says.

Drafters and reviewers should do an appropriate review of any material incorporated by reference, because the material likely will have the same force and effect as though it had been reproduced in the body of the document itself — possibly with unhappy results.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: An LOI-style term sheet (see Protocol <a href="#r-LOIRule">4.6</a> and its notes) incorporated by reference a confidentiality agreement ("NDA"; see Protocol <a href="#r-conf-info-proto">11.3</a>). The NDA included an exclusion of various types of damages. The Seventh Circuit held that the exclusion — incorporated by reference into the LOI despite the plaintiff's objection — precluded the plaintiff from recovering expectation damages for breach. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/24-2794/24-2794-2025-12-23.html">37celsius Capital Partners, L.P. v.

<p>
Colorado's supreme court, citing other state supreme-court opinions, noted that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; for contract terms outside the four corners of a contract to be incorporated by reference into the contract, the terms to be incorporated generally must be clearly and expressly identified. &#x2026; General or oblique references to a document to be incorporated, in contrast, are usually insufficient to support a finding that the document was incorporated by reference. <cite> <a href="https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Court_Probation/Supreme_Court/Opinions/2020/20SC565.pdf">French v. Centura Health Corp.</a>, 2022 CO 20, 509 P.3d 443, ¶ 30-31 (Colo. 2022) (reversing court of appeals; extra paragraphing added, citations omitted). The <i>French</i> case is described in a Washington Post article: See Timothy Bella, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/19/colorado-hospital-surgery-cost-french/">She expected to pay $1,337 for surgery. She was billed $303,709</a> (WashingtonPost.com May 19, 2022). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
This general rule is likely to apply with special force in insurance policies. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12905072768624688590">ExxonMobil Corp. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co.</a>, 672 S.W.3d 415 (Tex. 2023) (reversing and remanding appeals court's reversal of summary judgent in favor of Exxon). </cite>
</p>

<p>
And wording can matter, with much depending on the court. EXAMPLE: The "Warranty" section of one contract stated: "For a complete list of our Terms & Conditions and Warranty details, please visit our website at <i>[omitted]</i>." Affirming denial of a motion for prevailing-party attorney fees, the First Circuit noted the general consensus that for external terms to be considered part of a contract, "the contract must clearly communicate that the purpose of the reference is to incorporate the referenced material into the contract." The court held that "[t]his section did not convey a clear message that, by accepting the offer, Holsum would agree to bind itself to further promises (including the fee-shifting term)." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14573087020964039099">Holsum de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. ITW Food Equip. Grp., LLC</a> , 116 F.4th 59, 68 (1st Cir. 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Similarly:  The Department of Veterans Affairs asked for quotes to lease an item of surgical equipment. One vendor's representative said, in a transmittal email, "I have attached the quote with the terms and conditions <i>[which included mandatory exercise of renewal options by the VA]</i>; this needs to be part of the contract." That wasn't enough to incorporate the vendor's terms and conditions into the contract, said the Federal Circuit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The contract’s expressly incorporated FAR clauses provided the agency with complete discretion in exercising the option years. If Beacon Point intended to vary the terms of these FAR clauses by incorporating its Quote’s terms and conditions into the contract, it should have ensured that the contract <b>expressly</b> identified* that the Quote’s terms and conditions were incorporated into the contract. Beacon Point did not do so. Instead, <b>Beacon Point accepted a contract that references the Quote but does not clearly communicate</b> that the purpose of the reference was to incorporate the Quote’s terms into the contract. Thus, we hold that the contract does not incorporate by reference Beacon Point’s Quote. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7455267333459566856">Beacon Pt. Assoc. v. Dept. of Veteran Affairs</a>, 139 F.4th 1306, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2025) (affirming dismissal of vendor's appeal of denial of claim). </cite>

<b>Lesson:</b> Drafters would be well-advised to err on the side of explicitness.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-incorp-findable">
<p>
If you incorporate external material by reference, but the other party can't readily identify and find the material, then a court might hold that the external material isn't not part of the contract.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A contract form for the sale of hardwood flooring did <i>not</i> successfully incorporate "Terms of Sale," mentioned in the form, said Oklahoma's supreme court, because the contract form gave no indication where to find the referenced terms "beyond doubt" but instead made "nothing more than a vague allusion" to the terms. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8052079547137150687">Walker v. BuildDirect.com Technologies, Inc.</a>, 2015 OK 30, 349 P.3d 549, 551, 554 (2015) (on certification from 10th Circuit). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> At the very least, provide a Web link — preferably a short, easily-typed one — where the additional incorporated terms can be found.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-incorp-gen-ref">
<p>
When you reference external material in a contract, you'll want to be very clear that you intend to incorporate the material by reference. EXAMPLE: Illustrating this point, in <i>Facilities Cost Mgmt.</i> (Neb. 2015):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An architectural-services contract stated that "[t]he Architect’s Response to the District’s Request for Proposal <i>is attached</i> to this Agreement <i>for general reference purposes</i> including overviews of projects and services."</li>

<li>But the architect firm's response to the RFP <i>wasn't</i> attached to the contract — for that matter, the title wasn't even as stated in the contract provision.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Agreeing with the trial court, the state's supreme court held that "[t]he expression 'for general reference purposes,' interesting though it may be <i>[!]</i>, contrasts with a provision, common in contract law, which incorporates another document by reference. &#x2026; [The contract language] simply does not incorporate [the architect firm's] responses into the contract." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6385184800567074869">Facilities Cost Mgmt. Group v. Otoe Cty. Sch. Dist.</a>, 291 Neb. 642, 653-54, 868 N.W.2d 67, 71, 75 (2015) (affirming partial summary judgment but reversing and remanding on other issue); <i>after retrial</i>, 298 Neb. 777, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17314220210589652547">906 N.W.2d 1</a> (2018). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> It's not hard to see, though, how another court could have held that the contract <i>did</i> incorporate the architecture firm's guaranteed-maximum-price response.  
Still, the contract's drafters, who presumably worked for the school district, might have been more clear about their client's intent.

<div id="outline-container-incorp-clear-intent" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="incorp-clear-intent"><span class="section-number-5">4.3.2.5.</span> But a clear intent to incorporate might suffice</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-incorp-clear-intent">
<p>
In a Fifth Circuit case, the court held that a supplier's price quotation sufficiently incorporated by reference a standard-terms-and-conditions document published by the European Engineering Industries Association (the "<a href="https://licensing.orgalime.org/index.php/mainpage/en/">ORGALIME</a>"), which contained an arbitration provision.  
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; The supplier's price quotation didn't expressly incorporate the ORGALIME by reference; instead, the quotation stated, "Terms and conditions are <i>based on</i> the general conditions stated in the enclosed ORGALIME S2000." (Emphasis added.) 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; The Fifth Circuit reviewed Texas law on the point, summarizing that "when the reference to the other document is clear and the circumstances indicate that the intent of the parties was incorporation, courts have held that a document may be incorporated, even in the absence of specific language of incorporation."
</p>

<p>
The appeals court concluded that "the district court erred in holding there was no agreement to arbitrate." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11178317105542937464">Al Rushaid v.

Drafters should pay attention to just what portion or portions of another document are being incorporated by reference.  That issue made a difference in a Second Circuit decision where:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; Addendum 5 <i>[to the contract in question]</i> refers only to a single specific provision in <i>[another agreement]</i> — the non-compete clause. Where, as here, the parties to an agreement choose to cite in the operative contract only a specific portion of another agreement, we apply the well-established rule that a reference by the contracting parties to an extraneous writing for a particular purpose makes it part of their agreement <i>only for the purpose specified</i>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2584810560112221697">VRG Linhas Aereas S/A v. MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities Partners II L.P.</a>, No. 14-3906-cv (2d. Cir.

<p>
In an Eighth Circuit case:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; A buyer's purchase-order form referred to an external document with additional terms and conditions, and said the document would be provided on request.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; In a subsequent lawsuit, however, <i>the seller denied having ever received the additional document</i>. 
</p>

<p>
That led to (what had to have been) an expensive court fight over whether an arbitration provision and an indemnification provision were part of the contract.
</p>

<p>
The case gives us a nice illustration of the <a href="#nl-battle-forms">Battle of the Forms</a>; the Eighth Circuit ruled that the district court should have conducted a bench trial (no jury was demanded) to make findings of fact about just who had received what contract documents, and therefore just what terms were, or were not, part of the parties' contract under UCC § 2-207. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3623670188297272607">Nebraska Machinery Co. v. Cargotec Solutions, LLC</a>, 762 F.3d 737 (8th Cir. 2014). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Lesson:</b> It's understandable that the buyer didn't want the hassle and expense of having to provide a hard copy of its additional terms and conditions form with every purchase order. Merely offering to provide a copy of the form, though, might well have been insufficient to bind the seller to its terms. The buyer could have put itself in a stronger position in court if it had posted the form on its Web site and then included a link to the form in its printed purchase order.

<p>
Failing to incorporate everything you want into a contract could result in losing rights your client thought it had. EXAMPLE: In a Third Circuit decision:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Nationwide online used-car dealer Carvana tried unsuccessfully to compel arbitration of a class action brought by some of its buyers.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Carvana had included a separate arbitration agreement in the set of agreements signed by the buyers.
</p>

<p>
The district court court held, and the Third Circuit affirmed, that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable under Pennsylvania's Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act ("MVSFA") because the buyer's installment-sale contract did not incorporate the arbitration agreement, as required by that statute:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Under Pennsylvania's MVSFA, a contract governing <i>an installment sale</i> must, inter alia: (1) be in writing; (2) <i>contain all of the agreements</i> between a buyer and an installment seller relating to the installment sale of the motor vehicle sold; and (3) be signed by the buyer and seller.
</p>

<p>
The statute creates <i>a one-document rule</i> for the installment purchases of vehicles requiring that all agreements between the parties must be <i>incorporated into</i> the RISC <i>[Retail Installment Sale Contract]</i>. &#x2026; Here, the arbitration agreements exist independently of the RISCs and are therefore unenforceable. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3734419765691893284">Jennings v. Carvana, LLC</a>, No. 22-2948, slip op. (3d Cir. Mar. 21, 2024) (nonprecedential; affirming denial of Carvana's motion to compel arbitration; cleaned up, emphasis and extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Carvana's <a href="https://marylandconsumer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/16-Carvana-opening-brief-and-joint-apx-vol-1-1.pdf">brief</a> had pointed out (at 3) that the district court refused to enforce the parties' arbitration agreement "because the RPA [Retail Purchase Agreement] incorporated the RISC and not the other way around." The district court <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17777152943153543433">took it as a given</a> that an arbitration agreement could be incorporated <i>by reference</i> and did not have to be reproduced in the body of the RISC.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-incorp-po">
<p>
A California appeals court case considered a purchase order that a prime contractor had issued to a subcontractor:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The purchase order mentioned — but did not expressly incorporate by reference — a sales quotation that the <i>subcontractor</i> had previously sent to the <i>prime</i> contractor.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Further down in the purchase order, though, the P.O. language referred to "the contract documents <i>described above or otherwise incorporated herein</i> &#x2026;." (Emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
Applying the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule of contract interpretation (see <a href="#r-contra-prof">14.1</a>), albeit without using that Latin phrase — and therefore construing the quoted term in favor of the <i>subcontractor</i> — the court held that the phrase, "described above or <i>otherwise</i> incorporated" had the effect of incorporating the subcontractor's sales quotation by reference into the prime contractor's purchase order. <cite> See <a href="http://cases.justia.com/california/court-of-appeal/2016-f070067.pdf">Watson Bowman Acme Corp. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-incorp-pros-cons">
<p>
<i>An advantage:</i> Drafting can sometimes be speeded up, and contracts shortened considerably, by incorporating external material by reference. 
</p>

<p>
A classic example is the use of the INCOTERMS (International Commercial Terms), in purchase orders, to specify:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how goods are to be delivered; and</li>

<li>when title and the risk of loss will pass from the seller to the buyer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
(Concerning the INCOTERMS, see generally <a href="#nl-incoterms-cmt">15.6</a>.)
</p>

<p>
<i>A disadvantage:</i> It might be tempting not to review material that is incorporated by reference into a document, even though the material will almost certainly have the same force and effect as though the material had been fully set forth in the body of the document itself.
</p>

<p>
Incorporation by reference can even turn an unenforceable contract into an enforceable one. EXAMPLE: The Seventh Circuit held that a particular paragraph of a confidentiality agreement "was not enforceable by itself, but it could, as that paragraph expressly contemplated, combine with subsequent writings and/or conversations and/or conduct to become enforceable." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13311788464416493533">R3 Composites Corp. v.

<h4 id="initials-missing"><span class="section-number-4">4.4.2.</span> Maybe <i>don't</i> include lines for initialing particular provisions?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-initials-missing">
<p>
As an example of the "Don't Needlessly Raise the Bar for Your Client" Principle (see <a href="#bar-clear">30.13</a>): Unless specifically required by law, it's not a great idea to include separate lines for initialing a particular provision of a contract.  That's because it's too easy for a party to forget (or intentionally fail) to initial the provision; that could lead to a dispute about whether the party <i>in fact</i> agreed to the non-initialed provision — which in turn could lead to costly litigation, perhaps with unpredictable outcomes.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-4-3">
<p>
In the modern era of electronic documents and signatures, it's not often that parties make handwritten changes on a paper copy of a contract. If that's to be done, however, each party's signer should initial and date each such change. 
</p>

<p>
For an example of changes made in red comment bubbles in a PDF document, see a <a href="https://www.adamsdrafting.com/marking-changes-on-the-signature-copy-of-a-contract/">2019 blog post</a> by Ken Adams — where a commenter points out that the changes should have been initialed, otherwise it might be tough to prove that the changes were part of the signed document.

Suppose that "Alice" is signing <i>a hard copy</i> of a contract, whether for herself or on behalf of her company. It's not the worst idea (but not strictly necessary) for Alice to initial the hard copy at the bottom-right corner of each page <i>and keep a photocopy of the entire contract with the initialed pages.</i> That can be useful if, for example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>different parties sign different versions of the contract, which has been known to happen, as discussed at <a href="#sigs-signed-pages-cmtry">4.14.1</a>; or</li>

<li>another party surreptitously changes the contract language <i>after</i> Alice signs, and then claims that Alice agreed to the change — that, too, has been known to happen, as discussed at Protocol <a href="#r-sig-integ-top">2.9</a> — in which case Alice can produce her photocopy of the pages she initialed, without the surreptitious change.</li>

Background: It's been known to happen that a party will sign a contract without getting its own legal advice — and then when things turn sour, the party files a malpractice lawsuit against <i>another party's</i> lawyers, to the effect of (for example), <i>wait, I thought you were</i> <b>my</b> <i>lawyer too, but you had a conflict of interest and didn't disclose that to me</i>.

<p>
To be sure: The law <i>might</i> protect one party's attorney from claims of that sort by another, non-client party. Even so, language such as that of this § <a href="#sigs-legal-rev-rel">4.5.3</a> can be cheap insurance, helping discourage parties from bringing such claims in the first place and helping lawyers get such claims thrown out early. <cite> See generally, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8420975646347182543">Haynes and Boone, LLP v.

Letters of intent ("LOIs") are quite common in merger- and acquisition ("M&A") transactions, but they're sometimes used in commercial transactions that have a long "take-off runway" before the final agreement will be signed.

This section performs one of the most important functions of an LOI by helping to establish that parties <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> <i>haven't</i> yet agreed to be bound, because a binding LOI could have serious consequences. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4709490730612090550">Stackpole Int’l Engineered Prods., Ltd.v. Angstrom Auto. Grp.</a>, 52 F.4th 274 (6th Cir. 2022) (affirming judgment on jury verdict that party had breached LOI). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Here's a Houston-famous (albeit tangential) example: Oil giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texaco">Texaco</a> — a stranger to a corporate-acquisition transaction — learned this the (very) hard way in the 1980s, when a jury hit Texaco with a damages verdict of some $29 billion (in 2025 dollars) for swooping in and acquiring Getty Oil after Getty had signed what was ruled to be a <i>binding</i> "memorandum of understanding" (tantamount to an LOI) between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennzoil">Pennzoil</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Oil">Getty Oil</a>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11763000609638124594">Texaco, Inc. v. Pennzoil Co.</a>, 729 S.W.2d 768 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1986, writ. ref’d n.r.e.); see generally Robert M. Lloyd, <a href="https://ir.law.utk.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1073&context=transactions">Pennzoil v. Texaco, Twenty Years After: Lessons for Business Lawyers</a>, 6. Transactions: Tenn. J. Bus. L. 321 (2005). </cite>
</p>

<p>
So by explicitly disclaiming any binding intent, an LOI can provide some breathing room. <cite> For additional discussion, see, e.g., <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-real-estate-parties-should-45360">Brown & Grinnell</a> (2020) (real-estate LOIs); <a href="https://docket.acc.com/letter-intent-should-not-spoil-venture">Jaskolka & Strnad</a> (2020); Cathy Hwang, <a href="https://virginialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hwang_Book.pdf#page=29">Faux Contracts</a>, 105 Va.

This language addresses a <i>possible</i> (but unlikely) concern: Sometimes when parties sign an LOI, the parties' business people decide to "get going" before the lawyers finish the final, formal contract. For example: It's been said that in Hollywood, the process of making a movie will sometimes gets started — and even be finished — long before written agreements get signed, which might <i>never</i> happen. <cite> See, e.g., Jonathan M. Barnett, <a href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3790&context=dlj">Hollywood Deals: Soft Contracts for Hard Markets</a>, 64 Duke L.J. 605, part II (2015); Shuangjun Wang, <a href="https://legalstudies.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Shuangjun-Wang-Sp13.pdf">Let’s Do Something New for Lunch: Re-evaluating Hollywood Handshake Deals</a> (Berkeley.edu 2013). </cite>

<p>
That <i>could</i> lead to a holding that the parties' actions had the legal effect of creating a <i>de facto</i> or <i>implied</i> partnership — with the result that the parties had fidudicary obligations to each other under <i>partnership</i> law. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BO/htm/BO.152.htm">Tex. Bus. Org.

<p>
Let's use "Fred" and "Ginger" as names for hypothetical parties in listing a few examples of some the possible things that might concern Ginger:
</p>

<p>
1.  Ginger would want to know if a <i>third party</i> had the right to veto or otherwise control Fred's performance under the contract.
</p>

<p>
2.  Fred might not have told Ginger that the contract between Ginger and Fred would be <i>a subcontract</i> of a contract between Fred and a governmental entity — and <i>that</i> could result in <i>Ginger</i> unwittingly becoming, <i>by law</i>,  bound by various "flowdown" obligations, discussed (briefly) at [BROKEN LINK: flowdown-cmt].
</p>

<p>
3.  Fred might not have told Ginger that he was currently the subject of a lawsuit by a third party that could prevent Fred from honoring his contractual obligations to Ginger.
</p>

<p>
4.  Fred might not have told Ginger that he was under an injunction (or judgment, or regulatory restriction) that could lead to trouble for Ginger.
</p>

<p>
5.  Fred might not have told Ginger that he (or perhaps some of his relevant employees) was:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>subject to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2006-title45-vol1/xml/CFR-2006-title45-vol1-part76.xml">debarment</a> or other exclusion from dealing with the U.S. Government, for example for Medicare fraud or the like;</li>

<li>barred under export-control laws, government sanctions, or the like.</li>
</ul>

<p>
5.  Fre d might not have told Ginger that he had been doing business with a third party, "Harry," and that if Ginger and Fred entered into <i>their</i> contract, then Harry might sue <i>Ginger</i> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interference">tortious interference</a>. A tortious-interference lawsuit by a disgruntled party can have catastrophic results. EXAMPLE: Oil giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texaco">Texaco</a> (now part of Chevron) was hit with a damage award of some $10.5 billion, or more than $29 billion in 2025 dollars, for tortiously interfering with what the jury and the courts found to be a binding memorandum of understanding between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennzoil">Pennzoil</a> (now part of Shell) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Oil">Getty Oil</a>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11763000609638124594">Texaco, Inc. v. Pennzoil Co.</a>, 729 S.W.2d 768 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1986, writ. ref’d n.r.e.).</cite>
</p>

<p>
6.  Fred might not have told Ginger about facts indicating that Fred lacked the legal power to enter into their contract — meaning that if Fred were later to suffer buyer's remorse, he might later try to use his lack of legal power to <i>void</i> their contract.
</p>

<p>
7.  Fred might not have told Ginger that he knew he wasn't capable of carrying out his obligations under the contract. EXAMPLE: In 2010, a court finding of similar conduct resulted in EDS, a giant U.S. computer-services company (later acquired by HP), settling a lawsuit with British Sky Broadcasting for some USD $460 million — <i>more than four times the value of the contract</i> between the parties. (See the discussion of this case at <a href="#RelDisclBkgd">22.34.6.7</a>.)  Regardless: As a practical matter, Ginger likely cares more about getting business done than with hypothetically being able to sue Fred someday. She might well prefer to know, early on, about Fred's incapability so she could consider looking elsewhere.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-notary-top">
<p>
Typically, it won't be necessary (nor desirable) to get a contract "notarized." Sometimes, however, a party <i>will</i> want, and might <i>need</i>, to get "ancillary" documents — for example, a deed or an assignment of rights — "acknowledged" before a notary public (or other official) by one of more of the signers.

<h4 id="NotarizationBasics"><span class="section-number-4">4.8.1.</span> One form of "notarizing" means acknowledging that <i>you</i> signed.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-NotarizationBasics">
<p>
A document such as a deed to real property might include, after the signature blocks, a space for a notary public (or other official) to sign a certificate that the signer:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>appeared before the notary;</li>

<li><i>presented sufficient evidence</i> to establish his or her identity (e.g., a driver's license, a passport, etc.); and</li>

<li>stated to the notary that he or she (the signer) signed the document.</li>
</ol>

<p>
(The other common form of notarizing is the jurat, or oath by the signer, discussed at <a href="#notar-jurat-c">4.8.3</a>.)
</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-notary-why" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="notary-why"><span class="section-number-4">4.8.2.</span> A notary acknowledgement reduces the chance of forgery.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-notary-why">
<p>
When a document signer "acknowledges" his- or her signature as summarized above, the certificate and official seal of the notary public (or other authorized official) serve as legally-acceptable evidence that the signer's signature isn't a forgery — that is, evidence that the signed document is authentic. This is sometimes referred to as making the document <i>self-authenticating</i> or <i>self-proving</i>.
</p>

<p>
And indeed, the law likely <i>requires</i> a certificate of acknowledgement by an authorized official if the document is to be recorded in the public records so as to put the public on notice of the document's contents. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE:  Suppose that "Alice" is selling her house.  
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  To do so, Alice will pretty much always sign a deed and give the signed deed to "Bob," the buyer.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Bob will normally want to take (or send) the signed deed to the appropriate government office to have the deed officially recorded — that way, under state law, third parties will be on notice that <i>Bob</i> now owns Alice's house.
</p>

<p>
But how can the government office, or for that matter a later title researcher, know for sure that "Alice's" signature on the deed to wasn't a forgery?  
</p>

<p>
The answer is that under the laws of most states, Alice's deed to Bob won't even be eligible for recording in the official records unless the deed includes an acknowledgement certificate — signed by a notary public or other authorized official — that Alice complied with the three numbered requirements at the beginning of this subclause.
</p>

<p>
(And if Alice signed the deed in a special capacity, such as executor of her father's estate, then the notary's certificate will usually say that, too.)
</p>

<p>
This acknowledgement procedure allows the civil servants who must record Alice's deed to look at the deed and have at least some confidence that the signature on it isn't a forgery.
</p>

<p>
(A notary acknowledgement also makes it considerably difficult for Alice to later try to disavow her signature.)
</p>

<p>
In some jurisdictions, Alice is not required to actually <i>sign</i> the deed in the presence of the notary; she need only state to the notary that yes, she did in fact signed the deed. <cite> See generally Kelle Clarke, <a href="https://www.nationalnotary.org/notary-bulletin/blog/2015/04/key-differences-acknowledgment-jurat-certificates">Notary Essentials: The Difference Between Acknowledgments And Jurats</a> (NationalNotary.org 2020). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-notar-jurat-c">
<p>
Not usually: The type of notary certificate we're discussing here — an "acknowledgement" — is a different type of certificate than a <a href="https://www.nationalnotary.org/notary-bulletin/blog/2015/04/key-differences-acknowledgment-jurat-certificates">jurat</a>. When a jurat is used in a document, the notary or other official certifies that the <i>signer</i> of the document personally declared — after first promising to tell the truth, <i>under penalty of perjury</i> — that the document's contents were true.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-8-4">
<p>
State law usually specifies just what wording must appear in an acknowledgement signed before a notary. For example, under Texas law,  an individual's signature can be acknowledged using a short form:  
</p>


<div class="bordered" id="org4323fae">
<p>

</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-notary-well-bound">
<p>
In our above Alice-and-Bob example: Once Alice has done as required, the notary will also sign the certificate and imprint a seal on the deed. The notary might do this with a handheld "scruncher" that embosses the paper of the deed, or instead with an ink stamp; this will depends on the jurisdiction.  
</p>

<p>
Typically, the notary is also required to make an entry in a journal to serve as a permanent record.   <b>Pro tip:</b> It's useful to confirm that the notary in fact did this — a family friend of the present author once won a lawsuit by getting a notary to admit, on cross-examination, that she (the notary) had <i>not</i> made such an entry in the "well-bound book" that was then required by state law.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-AcknowWhoElse">
<p>
By statute, certain officials other than notaries public* are authorized to certify the authenticity of signatures in certain circumstances. For example, Texas law gives the power to certify signature acknowledgements:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to district-court and county-court clerks, and</li>

<li><i>(in certain limited cases)</i> to commissioned officers of the U.S. armed forces,</li>

</p>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-AcknowNotaryConflict">
<p>
A notary public generally can't sign a certificate if the notary has a conflict of interest, e.g., notarizing something for an immediate-familly member. <cite> See generally, e.g., American Society of Notaries, <a href="http://www.asnnotary.org/?form=conflictofinterest">Conflicts of Interest</a> (2008). </cite>
</p>

<p>
But under Texas law, when a notary public is an employee of a corporation, the notary is allowed to certify the acknowledgement of a signature on a document in which the corporation has an interest, <i>unless</i> the employee is a shareholder who owns more than a specified percentage of the stock of the corporation. <cite> See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CP/htm/CP.121.htm#121.002">§ 121.002</a>. </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-NotarizationFlaws">
<p>
Parties will want to double-check that the notary "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_the_needful">does the needful</a>" (an archaic but useful expression) to comply with statutory requirements. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: a New York case, Michelle and Gary Galetta signed a prenuptial agreement. When Gary filed for divorce some years later, Michelle asserted that the prenup was unenforceable. The court, agreeing with Michelle, voided the prenup, because the notary certificate for Gary's signature didn't recite that the notary public had confirmed his identity — even though it was undisputed that the couple's signatures were authentic, and there was no accusation of fraud or duress.
</p>

<p>
Affirming, New York's highest court said that the notarization requirement was important because it "necessarily imposes on the signer a measure of deliberation in the act of executing the document." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10391338104026105572">Galetta v. Galetta</a>, 21 N.Y.3d 186, 189-90, 191-92, 991 N.E.2d 684, 969 N.Y.S.2d 826 (2013) (affirming summary judgment that prenup was invalid). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-NotaryLawyerAsWitness">
<p>
In many states it's easy to become a notary public. Some lawyers themselves become notaries so that they can certify the authenticity of clients' signatures on wills, deeds, and the like. 
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind, though: If a lawyer notarizes a document, then the lawyer might be called someday to testify in a court proceeding about a signed document. For example, the lawyer-notary might have to explain how he or she confirmed the signer's identity if that information isn't stated in the lawyer's notary records. That in turn might disqualify the lawyer from being able to represent the client whose signature was certified. <cite> See, e.g., Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CP/htm/CP.121.htm">§ 121.001</a>; <a href="http://www.legalethicstexas.com/Ethics-Resources/Rules/Texas-Disciplinary-Rules-of-Professional-Conduct/III--ADVOCATE/3-08-Lawyer-as-Witness.aspx">Tex. Discipl. R. Prof. Conduct 3.08</a> ("Lawyer as Witness"). </cite>
</p>

<p>
(As a practical matter, though, that one point might not be too much of an issue, because the lawyer might already have to testify by virtue of having participated in the events leading up to the signing of the document.)

Some drafters might want to make this a one-way waiver, in which only one party is waiving reliance. EXAMPLE: Delaware's supreme court largely upheld a $1 billion Chancery-Court judgment that (among other things) Johnson & Johnson had engaged in common-law fraud, when it acquired Auris, one of J&J's potential competitors in the medical-robotics field (in which J&J had indirectly invested), by concealing information relevant to Auris's potential for succeeding in achieving milestones for an earn-out payment:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026; Auris, unlike J&J, made extensive representations in the Merger Agreement itself; J&J agreed that it therefore would not rely on anything outside the contract.

We therefore hold, consistent with <i>Abry</i>, that where (i) <i>the contract contains a one-sided anti-reliance clause disclaiming reliance by only one party</i>, and (ii) the other party to the contract made no comparable promise, an exclusive remedy clause cannot be invoked to bar the other party's post-closing claims for intentional extra-contractual fraud. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12056670684212718028">Johnson & Johnson v.

<h5 id="r-rel-discl-why-cmt"><span class="section-number-5">4.10.6.1.</span> Why include a reliance waiver?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-r-rel-discl-why-cmt">
<p>
Unlike some entire-agreement clauses, a <i>reliance waiver</i> could defeat a misrepresentation claim. That's why reliance waivers are often paired with entire-agreement clauses:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In an entire-agreement clause, a statement that "there are no other representations" might not be enough to defeat a claim of fraudulent inducement to enter into the contract.</li>

<li>But: Under the law in many U.S. jurisdictions, a contracting party (the "claimant") that claims misrepresentation by the other side normally would have to prove, among other things, <i>that it reasonably relied</i> on the alleged misrepresentation.</li>

<li>That gives the other side's contract drafter a reason to include an express <i>waiver</i> of reliance, which would (or at least should) make it unreasonable per se for the claimant to rely on the the alleged misrepresentation — because, by promising <i>not</i> to rely on outside statements, the claimant stipulated that such reliance would <i>not</i> be reasonable (although some courts will disregard a reliance waiver if it appears that the other party out-and-out lied).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's a hypothetical example: Suppose that the following takes place:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Fred and Ginger enter into a contract for Ginger to sell Fred a house located several hundred miles away from either of them.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  In the contract, Ginger <i>represents</i> to Fred that the house is in good condition, but does not <i>warrant</i> it.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  After the closing, the house turns out to be a wreck.
</p>

<p>
Even though Ginger didn't <i>warrant</i> the condition of the house, Ginger might be liable for <i>misrepresentation</i>. For Fred to succeed with a misrepresentation claim, though, he would have had to "hit the checkpoints" along the way up the <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">Hill of Proof</a> (see <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>) for some additional elements of proof: Fred would have to show (probably among other things) that he had <i>reasonably relied</i> on Ginger's representation.
</p>

<p>
Of course, Fred might well have a powerful incentive to prove his reasonable reliance: If he could establish Ginger's liability for misrepresentation, then he might be able:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to rescind the contract, and/or</li>

<li>perhaps even to recover punitive damages from Ginger; <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6588631383722707662">Huy Fong Foods, Inc. v. Underwood Ranches, LP</a>, 66 Cal. App. 5th 1112, 1126, 281 Cal. Rptr. 3d 757 (2021) (affirming $23 million jury verdict for breach of contract and fraud). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
neither of those remedies would normally be available in a breach-of-warranty action.
</p>

<p>
So Ginger will want to head off accusations that she lied — planning ahead, she <i>might</i> want to include, in the contract, a statement that Fred <i>isn't</i> relying on any representations by Ginger. That way, if Fred were to sue Ginger for misrepresentation, a judge might very well rely (so to speak) on the disclaimer and summarily toss out Fred's claim by dismissing it on the pleadings. When a reliance disclaimer is sufficiently clear — and especially when the contracting parties are big enough to take care of themselves — many courts might well give effect to the disclaimer under freedom-of-contract principles. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17946456559357999156">IBM v.

Tzolis</a>, 20 N.Y.3d 228, 233-34 (2012). </cite>> EXAMPLE: The Eighth Circuit had zero sympathy for a group of grocery store owner-operators who signed up as licensees of a discount grocery chain — the owner-operators had not only done due-diligence homework, with the aid of attorneys and other advisors, but had also signed extensive anti-reliance disclaimers.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In another Eighth Circuit case, the Mayo Foundation granted a license to a startup company under a patent application that Mayo had filed for certain nano technology. In the license agreement, the startup company "warranted that it had 'independently evaluated the Patent Rights, Know-How, and Confidential Information &#x2026; [and] is entering into this Agreement on the basis of its own evaluation <i>and not in reliance o[n] any representation by Mayo</i> &#x2026;.'"  (Emphasis added.)  The license agreement also disclaimed any implied warranties by Mayo about the patentability of the technology, among other things; the agreement stated that the licensed subject matter was being provided “as is,” “with all faults,” and “with all defects.”
</p>

<p>
Things apparently didn’t go well for the startup company: The patent application died when (1) the patent examiner issued a non-final rejection of the pending claims in the patent application, citing prior art, and (2) the startup company, which was to take over responsibility for pursuing the patent application, failed to respond to the examiner's rejection within the six-month period prescribed by the patent statute.
</p>

<p>
The startup company then sued Mayo, alleging among other things that Mayo had engaged in fraud and misrepresentation. (The startup company had raised $500,000 in funding from investors; conceivably the lawsuit might have represented an attempt by the startup company to divert investor anger away from the company's management and toward Mayo.)
</p>

<p>
The district court held — and the Eighth Circuit affirmed — that the startup company’s fraud- and negligent-misrepresentation claims against Mayo were barred by the reliance disclaimer in the license agreement. This was because, under Minnesota law,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>actual <i>and reasonable</i> reliance on the alleged misrepresentations was a required element of both claims, but</li>

<li><i>reasonable</i> reliance was conclusively negated by the reliance disclaimer quoted above. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15441169280319666786">OmegaGenesis Corp. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-rel-discl-cmt">
<p>
Under <b>Texas</b> law, the "no reliance" language above is important for drafters to understand. That's because, in the oft-cited <i>Italian Cowboy Partners</i> (2011), the state's supreme court explained:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
Pure merger clauses, <i>without an expressed clear and unequivocal intent to disclaim reliance or waive claims for fraudulent inducement</i>, have never had the effect of precluding claims for fraudulent inducement. &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
There is a significant difference between a party[:]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>disclaiming its <i>reliance</i> on certain representations, and therefore potentially relinquishing the right to pursue any claim for which reliance is an element, and</li>

<li>disclaiming the fact <i>[sic]</i> that no other representations were made.</li>
</ul>

<p>
 * * *
</p>

<p>
We have repeatedly held that <b>to disclaim <i>reliance</i>, parties must use clear and unequivocal language</b>. this elevated requirement of precise language helps ensure that parties to a contract — even sophisticated parties represented by able attorneys — <b>understand that the contract's terms disclaim reliance</b>, such that <b>the contract may be binding even if it was induced by fraud</b>.
</p>

<p>
Here, the contract language was <span class="underline">not</span> clear or unequivocal about disclaiming reliance. For instance, the term "rely" does not appear in any form, either in terms of relying on the other party's representations, or in relying solely on one's own judgment. This provision stands in stark contrast to provisions we have previously held were clear and unequivocal. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11381898603191801741">Italian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v.

</p>


<p>
DCT comment: It could be argued that these two disclaimers — a disclaimer of external representations, versus a disclaimer of <i>reliance</i> on external representations — logically amount to exactly the same thing (you can't rely on a representation that doesn't exist). The <i>Italian Cowboy Partners</i> quotation above suggests that in the Texas supreme court's view, a disclaimer of extrinsic representations, standing alone, is insufficiently explicit and "in your face" to alert the other side about what it was being asked to give up.
</p>

<p>
<b>Delaware</b> law <a id="orgf2ae0ac"></a> likewise requires anti-reliance language in order to preclude a fraud claim. As the Chancery Court explained: "[A]n integration clause, standing alone, is not sufficient to bar a fraud claim; the agreement must also contain explicit anti-reliance language" — <b>except that</b> "an integration clause alone is sufficient to bar a fraud claim based on expressions of future intent or future promises." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6128233748677172493">Trifecta Multimedia Holdings Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
<b>Colorado</b> law is to the same effect: "[T]he mere fact of a merger clause does not effect a waiver of the tort claim. And unlike <i>[a prior case]</i> in which the court found that a merger clause precluded a fraudulent-inducement claim because it disproved reliance as a matter of law, the merger clause here says nothing about reliance." <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca10/24-1152/24-1152-2025-07-23.html">City of Fort Collins v.

</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> If you're drafting a contract where the law will be that of a jurisdiction such as Texas or Delaware or Colorado, it's likely to be important to include an explicit reliance waiver — but that might be a "red flag" that causes the other party to wonder whether your client is trustworthy &#x2026;.

Suppose that Ginger claims that Fred misrepresented facts to induce Ginger to enter ito a contract, <i>and that Fred's misrepresentation wasn't merely negligent, but intentional</i>. AND: Suppose also that the contract contains a no-reliance clause. In such a situation, Fred should not hold out much hope that a court would <i>summarily</i> toss out Ginger's fraudulent-inducement claim against him; the judge might very well insist on a full trial. <cite> See generally Andrew M.

That might be even more true if the plaintiff was not "sophisticated" and/or was not represented by counsel in the transaction in question. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/texas/first-court-of-appeals/2004/79979.html">Carousel's Creamery, L.L.C. v.

COUNTEREXAMPLE: Delaware's chancery court held that when a party allegedly made a representation <i>in a contract</i>, <i>knowing it to be false</i>, the contract's anti-reliance and non-recourse clauses would not bar a fraud claim.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026; while contractual limitations on liability are effective when used in measured doses, the Court cannot sit idly by at the pleading stage while a party alleged to have lied in a contract uses that same contract to detonate the counter-party’s contractual fraud claim.

<b>Another counterexample:</b> The Bank of America once sold a foreclosed home subject to an "as-is" disclaimer — <i>but the bank stated that it had "little or no direct knowledge" of problems</i>, when <i>in fact</i> the bank's people knew that there were serious mold problems. A Wisconsin appeals court affirmed judgment on a jury verdict in favor of the buyer, saying that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict that the Bank made <b>a deceptive statement</b> concerning the sale of the property <i>[namely, that the bank had little or no direct knowledge of the condition of the house]</i> with the intention of inducing the sale of the property and that Fricano suffered a loss as a result of that representation. The “as is” and exculpatory clauses in the parties' contract do not, as a matter of law, relieve the bank/seller of liability under § 100.18(1) for its deceptive representation in the contract which induced agreement to such terms.

<p>
Express non-reliance provisions are increasingly common in merger and acquisition transactions, and have tripled in prevalence over the six ABA studies since 2009. These provisions have become the majority approach, appearing in 63% of agreements in 2019. Fraud carve-outs are increasingly seen in non-reliance provisions, showing a steady and pronounced increase since 2015—from 2% to 17% to 54%. <cite> <a href="https://www.goulstonstorrs.com/daniel-r-avery/">Daniel Avery</a>, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/non-reliance-and-nor-provisions-6575736">Non-Reliance and NOR Provisions</a> (JDSupra 2021), <i>summarizing</i> American Bar Association Section of Business Law, <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/committees/ma/deal_points/">2019 Private Target Deal Points Study</a> (AmericanBar.org) (ABA member login required). </cite>

Delaware courts (where a high proportion of M&A-related disputes are litigated) are likely to hold parties to the terms of their non-reliance disclaimers — but as one experienced corporate practitioner has noted, "even when fraud claims premised upon extra-contractual representations have been precluded by a non-reliance clause, <i>the express written representations</i> can sometimes provide a basis for a claim of fraud, at least at the motion to dismiss stage." <cite> Glenn D. West, <a href="https://privateequity.weil.com/glenn-west-musings/recent-delaware-cases-illustrating-how-uncapped-fraud-claims-can-and-cannot-be-premised-upon-written-representations/">Recent Delaware Cases Illustrating How Uncapped Fraud Claims Can and Cannot Be Premised Upon Written Representations</a> (PrivateEquity.Weil.com 2020) (emphasis added). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-rep-contra-k">
<p>
The Texas supreme court observed that "reliance upon an oral representation that is directly contradicted by the express, unambiguous terms of a written agreement between the parties is not justified as a matter of law." In that case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An oil-well operator, negotiating a lease with the owner of a mineral interest, allegedly represented orally that the operator intended to drill on the lease and that it wasn't in the busines of "flipping" mineral interests.</li>

<li>But later the operator did indeed flip the mineral interest — so the owner sued, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>

<li>The owner had a problem: The parties' agreement gave the operator "an unqualified right to transfer the lease rather than drill. This unqualified transfer right, clearly expressed in writing and agreed to by [the owner], directly contradicts the notion that [the operator] bound itself orally not to transfer the lease and instead to drill."</li>
</ul>

<p>
The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the operator; an appellate court reversed, but the state supreme court reversed again, reinstating the summary judgment. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15953252214638608896">Roxo Energy Co., LLC v.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-side-ltr">
<p>
When a supplier and customer sign a sale contract, it can be tempting also to have the supplier provide the customer with a "side letter" that gives the customer the right to return the product and get a refund. <b>That, though, could get the customer ensnarled</b> in a securities fraud case against the supplier; that, in turn, could disqualify the <i>customer</i> from utilizing some securities-offering procedures — as well as hindering the future employment prospects of the <i>individuals</i> involved.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In 2003, the SEC announced that it had filed a civil lawsuit against a former <i>customer</i> sales executive who allegedly placed a $7 million order with a supplier — with a secret side letter giving the customer the right to cancel its purchase. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>According to the SEC, the customer sales executive not only knew that the supplier planned to fraudulently misstate its financial results, he even advised the supplier's own sales people how to conceal the cancellation right from the supplier's finance department. <cite> See Securities and Exchange Commission Press Release, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-108.htm">SEC Charges Former Logicon Executive With Aiding and Abetting Financial Accounting Fraud at Legato Systems</a>, Sept. 8, 2003 (SEC.gov). </cite></li>
<li>The customer's executive later consented to a $35,000 fine <i>and</i> a cease-and-desist order prohibiting him from future violations — which was not a good career move, because it's the sort of thing that can hinder someone's future job prospects, possibly disqualifying the person from certain regulated- or licensed positions in the financial industry. <cite> See Securities and Exchange Commission Litigation Release No. 19385, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19385.htm">Court Enters Final Judgment Against Former Sales Executive of Customer of Legato Systems, Inc.</a>, Sept. 21, 2005 (SEC.gov). </cite></li>
</ul>
<p>
EXAMPLE: In 2007, a former CEO was sentenced to four years in prison for securities fraud that included, among other things, the use of secret side letters to "cook the books." <cite> See <a href="https://www.nhbr.com/ex-enterasys-ceo-sentenced-to-four-years/">Ex-Enterasys CEO sentenced to four years</a> (NHBR.com 2007); see also, e.g., Joel M.

<p>
Contracts generally get "signed" in some fashion; under U.S. law, contract signatures can take a variety of forms, as discussed in the commentary below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> As first-year law students learn, a so-called <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/unilateral_contract">unilateral contract</a> can be formed <i>without</i> signatures from both parties if an unrevoked, otherwise-eligible offer is accepted by performance. <i>Example:</i> Alice posts handbills on light poles, offering a $100 reward for the return of her missing cat, "Fluffy."  If Bob finds Fluffy and returns her to Alice, then Bob's performance constitutes completion of the contract and obligates Alice to pay Bob the reward money.

<h4 id="sig-concl-para"><span class="section-number-4">4.12.1.</span> Precede with a concluding paragraph? (Nah.)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-sig-concl-para">
<p>
Some conventional contracts, with the signature blocks at the end of the contract, precede the signature blocks with a concluding paragraph such as the following:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org13d9853">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     To evidence the parties’ agreement to this Agreement, each party has executed and delivered it on the date indicated under that party’s signature.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>     AGREED:
</p>

</div>

<p>
Concluding paragraphs such as the first option above aren't needed. Here's why:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, it's overkill: There are other ways of proving up that The Other Side in fact delivered a signed contract to you — for starters, the fact that you have a copy in your possession that bears (what at least purports to be) The Other Side’s signature.</li>

<li>Second, at the instant of signature, a <i>past-tense</i> statement that each party "has delivered" the signed contract is technically inaccurate — and even more so at the moment when the <i>first</i> signer affixes his (or her) signature.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>But:</b> If you see this kind of language in a draft prepared by the other side, then <b>don't change it</b> (as discussed in <a href="#k-rev-tips">30.11</a>).

</div>
<div id="outline-container-sig-dates-cmt" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sig-dates-cmt"><span class="section-number-4">4.12.2.</span> Signature dates</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-sig-dates-cmt">
<p>
DCT note: I usually draft signature blocks with blanks for the signers to <i>hand-write</i> the date signed; see the example shown at <a href="#sig-blocks-front-cmt">5.2.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's usually better <b>not</b> to <b>type in</b> the expected date of signature. That's because one or more parties might sign on a different date. Moreover, if signature is delayed, a pre-typed signature date could help an unscrupulous signer to passively — but still fraudulently — backdate the contract (see <a href="#bkdate-cmt-ca">5.1.9</a>).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>     "Signed on the dates indicated below" 
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     "Signed December 12, 20xx"
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For similar reasons relating to backdating, it's better <b>not</b> to type a purported date in the preamble:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>     "This Agreement is made effective the last date signed, as handwritten in the signature blocks, between &#x2026;."
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>     "This Agreement is made effective December 31, 20xx between &#x2026;."
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     "This Agreement is made December 31, 20XX, between …."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Relatedly: I also try to avoid leaving a blank space <i>in the preamble</i> for the effective date:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     "This Agreement is made December <i>[an underlined space]</i>, 20XX, between …."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's because the parties might well neglect to fill in the date, meaning that the contract gets signed with the blank space still there.

The signature blocks shown at <a href="#sig-blocks-front-cmt">5.2.1</a> (repeated below) are for different types of organization — on the left is a signature block for when the signer’s name and title are known; on the right, when not:
</p>

<p>
• Note that each of those signature blocks starts out with the word "AGREED:" in all-caps and followed by a colon — possibly including the abbreviation for the signing party, shown as "Licensor" and "Licensee" above.
</p>

<p>
• Each organization’s signature block lists the organization’s <b>full legal name</b> followed by the word "by" and a colon.
</p>

<p>
• Date signed: Each signer should <b>hand-write</b> the date signed, for reasons discussed at the commentary to <a href="#bkdate-cmt-ca">5.1.9</a>.
</p>

<p>
• Printed name blank line: In signature blocks with blank lines, be sure to include a space for the printed name, because the signatures of some people are difficult to read.
</p>

<p>
• Title: In any signature block for an organization, be sure to include the signer’s title, to establish a basis for concluding that the signer has authority to sign on behalf of the organization; if the employee’s title includes the word "president," "vice president," "manager," or "director" <i>in the relevant area of the business</i>, that might be enough to establish the employee’s apparent authority (concerning which, see <a href="#nl-app-auth">4.13.3</a>).

<h4 id="sigs-lps"><span class="section-number-4">4.12.6.</span> Special case: Signature block for a limited partnership</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-sigs-lps">
<p>
In many U.S. jurisdictions, a limited partnership might be able to act only through a general partner, in which case a signature block for the limited partnership might need to include the general partner’s name. And the general partner of a limited partnership might very well be a corporation or LLC; in that case, the signature block would be something like the following:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org2247899">
<p>
AGREED: ABC LP, by: <br>
ABC Inc., a Texas corporation, <br>
general partner, by:
</p>

<p>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <br>
Ronald R. Roe, <br>
Executive Vice President
</p>

<p>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <br>
Date signed
</p>

</div>

<p>
On the other hand, in some jurisdictions, a limited partnership might be able to act through its own officers; for example, Delaware’s limited-partnership statute gives general partners the power "to delegate to agents, officers and employees of the general partner or the limited partnership …." <cite> <a href="http://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c017/sc04/index.shtml#17-403">Del. Code § 17-403</a>(c) (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
In such cases, the signature block of a limited partnership might look like the signature block of a corporation or LLC, above.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> A <i>limited</i> partner who, acting in that capacity, signs a contract on behalf of the limited partnership could be exposing herself to claims that she should be held jointly and severally liable as a <i>general</i> partner. (Of course, some general partners also hold limited-partnership investment interests and thus are limited partners in addition to being general partners.)

<div id="outline-container-orgdc41df1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgdc41df1"><span class="section-number-4">4.12.7.</span> Include company titles for client relations, too</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-12-7">
<p>
Including company titles is highly advisable to help establish apparent authority, as discussed above. But there's another reason to do so: If your client is a company, then some individual human, typically an officer or manager of the company, will be signing on behalf of the client. In that situation, the client’s signature block in the contract should normally state that it’s <i>the company</i> that is signing the contract, <i>not</i> the individual human in his- or her personal capacity — with the attendant personal liability.
</p>

<p>
To be sure, if your client is the company and not the human signer, then technically you’re under no professional obligation to make sure that the human signer is protected from <i>personal</i> liability. But it’s normally not a conflict of interest for you to simultaneously look out for the human signer as well as for the company; doing that can give the human signer a warm fuzzy feeling about you, which is no bad thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> A lawyer might find herself dealing with an employee of a client company in a situation where the interests of the employee and the company diverge or even conflict. One example might be an investigation of possible criminal conduct such as deceptive backdating of a contract (discussed at <a href="#bkdate-cmt-ca">5.1.9</a>). In circumstances such as those, the lawyer should consider whether she should affirmatively advise the employee, <i>preferably in writing</i>, that she’s not the employee’s lawyer — conceivably, the lawyer might even have an ethical obligation to do so.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-sig-blks-same-pg">
<p>
DCT note: I like to keep all of the text of a signature block together on the same page (which might or might have other text on it). That looks more professional than having a signature block spill over from one page onto the next. This can be done using Microsoft Word’s paragraph formatting option, "Keep with Next."

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-counsel-sigs">
<p>
A lawyer for a party entering into a contract normally won’t want to be the one to sign the contract on behalf of her client, because:
</p>

<p>
FIRST: Signing a contract for a client could later raise questions whether, in the negotiations leading up to the contract, the lawyer was acting as a <i>lawyer</i> or as a <i>business person</i>. This could be an important distinction: in the latter case, the lawyer’s private communications with her client might not be protected by the attorney-client privilege and thus might be subject to discovery by third parties (which is never a good look, in terms of client relations).
</p>

<p>
SECOND: From a client-relations perspective, if your client's contract later "goes south," you might not want your signature on the contract. EXAMPLE: The general counsel of pharmaceutical giant Novartis was painfully reminded of this after <i>he</i> signed a consulting contract with Michael Cohen, formerly the personal lawyer for Donald Trump; as a result, the GC lost his job when the contract attracted unwanted publicity to the company. <cite> See Prashant S. Rao and Katie Thomas, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/business/novartis-trump-michael-cohen.html">Novartis’s Top Lawyer is Out Amid Furor Over Payments to Michael Cohen</a> (NYTimes.com May 16, 2018) (emphasis added). </cite>

<li>An ammunition manufacturer signed several nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) with the U.S. Government and, under the NDAs, disclosed allegedly-trade-secret technology to the government.</li>

<li>The manufacturer later sued the government for breaching the NDAs by disclosing and using the trade secrets without permission.</li>

<li>Under the applicable regulations, the specific individuals who signed the NDAs on behalf of the government did not have authority to bind the government.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court majority held that the government was not bound by some of the NDAs — and thus the government was not liable for its disclosure and use of the manufacturer's trade secrets. A dissenting judge argued that the senior Army officer who signed a particular NDA had at least apparent authority <i>[discussed at <a href="#nl-app-auth">4.13.3</a>]</i>; therefore, said the judge the government should have been bound by the NDA. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=746306080903254074">Liberty Ammunition, Inc. v.

Here’s another example from the Illinois supreme court: A landlord sued its defaulting tenant, a union local. The landlord won a $2.3 million judgment against the union in the trial court, only to see the award thrown out in the state supreme court. Why? Because in signing the lease, the union official had not complied with the requirements of the state statute that authorized an unincorporated association to lease or purchase real estate in its own name. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1441117512340720603">1550 MP Road LLC v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-app-auth">
<p>
Typically under the law in the U.S., anyone with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_authority">apparent authority</a> may sign a contract (or an amendment to a contract) on behalf of a party. 
</p>

<p>
Note: Apparent authority can arise only from some action on the part of the person supposedly granting authority; it can't arise solely from the actions of the person taking the action. 
</p>

<p>
Hypothetical example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Alice negotiates a contract with Bob, but the contract is between Bob and Carol.</li>

<li>Alice signs the contract — but she does so purportedly as Carol's agent.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that situation, Carol won't be bound by the contract unless <i>she</i> has given Bob reason to believe that Alice had authority to represent Carol. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/delaware/supreme-court/2025/199-2024.html">Caribbean Sun Airlines Inc. v. Halevi Enterprises LLC</a>, No. 199, 2024 (Del. Jan. 21, 2025) (reversing trial-court judgment). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Fifth Circuit affirmed a bankruptcy-court holding that an LLC was not bound by a contract to sell the LLC's future receivables: While the contract was signed by one of the LLC's members, the LLC's operating agreement imposed procedural hurdles for that member to enter the company into transactions — and the member didn't have apparent authority because the LLC had done nothing to give the impression that the member had authority. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1899075178680389333">Spin Capital LLC v.

<h4 id="nl-app-auth-no"><span class="section-number-4">4.13.4.</span> Consider <i>ruling out</i> apparent authority (more or less)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-app-auth-no">
<p>
A contract can generally negate <i>apparent</i> authority to sign by clearly putting the parties on notice that only certain people have authority to agree to amendments.
</p>

<p>
Such language is often seen, e.g., in car dealers' sales contracts, requiring manager- or vice-presidential signature on amendments — presumably, the purpose is to preclude buyers from claiming that a low-on-the-totem-pole sales representative had agreed to non-standard terms. Such language typically says, in all-caps, something along the lines of, "NO PERSON HAS AUTHORITY TO MODIFY THESE WARRANTIES ON BEHALF OF THE DEALER EXCEPT A VICE PRESIDENT OR HIGHER."
</p>

<p>
Here's a hypothetical example from our MathWhiz-Gigunda simulation:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org6d46bde">
<p>
Gigunda WILL NOT BE BOUND by this Agreement unless it is signed by its vice president for research.
</p>

</div>

<p>
So: Some drafters might want to be explicit about who does <i>not</i> have signature authority — and perhaps: authority to sign specific things — to help preclude another party from claiming to have relied on the apparent authority of other would-be signers.

<p>
A corollary to the above is that a party's <i>internal</i> signature-authority policies likely won't matter if the party has given the outside world sufficient reason to believe a particular individual has authority to sign and hasn't notified the other party otherwise. EXAMPLE: Something like happened, for example, in a Tenth Circuit case in which a company claimed — unsuccessfully — that it was supposedly not bound by a contract signed by one of its executive vice presidents ("EVPs"). <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7563082708224450355">Digital Ally, Inc., v.

In another case, a fired employee sued his former company, claiming that he had been promised a bonus by the company's  "vice president of operations," who was the son of the company's owners. In the lawsuit, the fired employee conceded that the son did not have <i>actual</i> authority to promise a bonus, but argued instead — and a jury agreed — that the son had <i>apparent</i> authority.   On appeal, the appellate court noted that:

<h4 id="sig-bd-resol"><span class="section-number-4">4.13.7.</span> The gold standard: A board resolution — but not for everyday</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-sig-bd-resol">
<p>
The gold standard of corporate signature authority is probably a certificate, signed by an officer of the corporation, that the corporation’s board of directors has granted the signature authority. 
</p>

<p>
You’ve probably seen paperwork that includes such a certificate if you’ve ever opened a corporate bank account. The resolution language — which is invariably drafted by the bank’s lawyers— normally says something to the effect that the company is authorized to open a bank account with the bank in question and to sign the necessary paperwork, along with many other things the bank wants to have carved in stone. <cite> See <a href="https://contracts.onecle.com/websidestory/imperial.sign.2000.03.15.shtml">this example</a> of a corporate board resolution and officer certificate (contracts.OneCLE.com). </cite>
</p>

<p>
But a large- or publicly-traded company won't want to bother its board approval to get approval for for routine contracts or other everyday business.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> When I was <a href="#bio">in-house</a>, we sometimes had to provide board resolutions for bank signature cards and things like that. So with our outside corporate counsel's blessing, we came up with this workaround:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The CFO (chief financial officer) was a board member; I was the secretary of the corporation, in addition to being vice president and general counsel, and thus was also an officer of the corporation.</li>

<li>The full board adopted a resolution that (1) created a subcommittee of one, namely the CFO, and (2) delegated, to that subcommittee, the power to approve bank board resolutions that had been approved by the company's general counsel (me).</li>

<li>So, whenever a bank asked for a board resolution: If I was OK with the resolution, the CFO would initial the signature line for the certificate of adoption; then I'd sign the certificate and return it to the bank. (Or maybe it was the other way around — I don't remember exactly.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
That approach worked: I don't recall that we ever got any pushback from a bank or otherwise had any trouble from the approach. (I doubt anyone at a bank ever looked at anything other than whether there was ink on the signature line and a title indicating that the signer was an officer, and so mentally "checked the box.")

<h4 id="nl-sig-auth-leg-lim"><span class="section-number-4">4.13.8.</span> Special case: Legal limits on signature authority</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-sig-auth-leg-lim">
<p>
By statute, a contract with an LLC or other organization might not be enforceable, even if signed by an "officer" or by a "manager." That could be especiall true if publicly-available articles of organization expressly <i>deprive</i> the signer of such authority — thus putting the public "on notice" of the lack of authority. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: This happened in <i>Spin Capital</i> (5th Cir. 2025): A member of an oilfield-services LLC, one Owen, held a 43% ownership interest in the company. Owen signed a contract to sell $4.5 million of the LLC's future receivables to a financing company for $3 million. The LLC's operating agreement stated that Owen could not enter the LLC into transactions without the consent of at least one of the LLC's other members. The Fifth Circuit affirmed dismissal of the financing company's claim against the LLC on grounds that Owen did not have actual authority to commit the LLC to the sale, and the LLC had done nothing to indicate that Owen had apparent authority. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/25-50206/25-50206-2025-12-04.html">Spin Capital LLC v.

<p>
EXAMPLE: This happened in a Utah case where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One manager of a two-manager LLC signed an agreement granting, to a tenant, a 99-year lease on a recreational-vehicle pad and lot.</li>

<li>But there was a problem: The LLC’s publicly filed articles of organization stated that neither of the two company’s managers had authority to act on behalf of the LLC without the other manager’s approval.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A state appeals court held that the tenant had been on notice of the one manager’s lack of authority to grant the lease on just his own signature alone — and so the lease was invalid. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14086744101008055471">Zions Gate RV Resort, LLC v. Oliphant</a>, 2014 UT App 98, 326 P.3d 118, 121 ¶ 8, 122-23. The court remanded the case for trial as to whether the LLC had later <i>ratified</i> the lease. </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-sig-auth-risk">
<p>
DCT note: I once represented a <a href="#hypo-facts">MathWhiz</a>-like client that was negotiating an agreement with a <a href="#hypo-facts">Gigunda</a>-like customer. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gigunda's attorney filled in a name and title for Gigunda's signer: It was a fairly-senior Gigunda individual contributor with a Ph.D degree. We'll call her "Sarah" (not her name).</li>

<li>In a private email to a MathWhiz senior executive, I raised the question of Sarah's authority to sign the agreement.</li>

<li>The MathWhiz executive responded that he'd had been dealing exclusively with Sarah in negotiating the agreement and understood why Gigunda wanted her to sign the agreement.</li>

<li>The MathWhiz executive added that Sarah's boss (whom the MathWhiz executive knew well) had been copied on all of the emails going back and forth.</li>

<li>The MathWhiz executive also said that MathWhiz had a longstanding good history with Gigunda.</li>
</ul>

<p>
After learning all of the above, my recommendation to MathWhiz was that we <i>not</i> ask Gigunda to have someone else sign the agreement (i.e., someone other than Sarah), because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>doing so might offend Sarah;</li>
<li>it would very-likely delay getting to signature;</li>
<li>it'd produce little or no <i>real</i> reduction in MathWhiz's business risk.</li>
</ul>

<p>
MathWhiz did as I recommended, accepting Sarah's signature as being on behalf of Gigunda. (It worked out fine: The parties carried out the contract to everyone's satisfaction.)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-sigs-signed-pages-cmtry">
<p>
A.&nbsp; It's very common for parties in separate locations to manually sign separate copies of a paper contracts and then to email a PDF image (or, old-school, to FAX) just their signed signature pages to each other. If only the signed signature pages of a contract will be exchanged, the parties should make sure it's clear that everyone is signing the same version of the document — otherwise, the contract might not be binding.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <i>Not</i> doing this proved fatal to a party's case in Delaware, where the parties had exchanged signature pages — but the pages were from <i>two different drafts</i>, only one of which included the crucial provision (a noncompetition covenant). The chancery court held that there had been no meeting of the minds — and thus there was not a valid contract. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16999054169873686895">Kotler v. Shipman Assoc., LLC</a>, No. 2017-0457-JRS (Del. Ch. Aug. 27, 2019) (rendering judgment for company). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> To help establish which draft of a document is which: Strongly consider including, <i>on each page</i> of the Con&shy;tract, a running header or -footer that identifies the document and its version.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> In a draft confidentiality agreement between ABC Corporation and XYZ LLC, a running header could read "ABC-XYZ Confid. Agrmt. ver. 2019-03-01 15:00 CST" — where the date and time at the end are <i>hand-typed</i>, and not in a "field" that the word processing software will automatically update.
</p>

<p>
(Including such a running header can also help avoid confusion when the parties are discussing a draft of the agreement, by allowing the parties to make sure that everyone is looking at the same draft.)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-sigs-dl-cmt">
<p>
A document could state a deadline for signature by one or more specified parties, so that the document would not be binding on any party unless each such specified party has signed <i>and delivered</i> the document:
&bull; to each other party stated in the deadline &bull; on or before the close of business, at that other party's place of business, on the stated deadline date.

<p>
It's a good idea to combine • the PDF of the unsigned agreement, and • the PDFs of the signed signature pages, into a single "record copy" PDF.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Are all parties are signing the same, final version of the document?  (<a href="#sigs-signed-pages-cmtry">4.14.1</a>)</li>

(<a href="#sigs-corp">4.12.3</a> through <a href="#sigs-lps">4.12.6</a>)</li>

<li>For each <i>organization</i> that is a party to the contract: Does the signature block includes the title of the individual signer within the organization, such as "Vice President of Business Development," to help establish the <a href="#nl-app-auth">apparent authority</a> of that individual signer to bind the organization?</li>

<li>In addition, does the contract itself <b>not</b> state that only certain people have authority to sign on behalf of one or more parties — either that, or such a person is signing on behalf of each such party? (<a href="#nl-app-auth-no">4.13.4</a>).</li>

<li>Does each party's signature block includes a blank line labeled "Date signed," <i>not</i> just "Date"?  (<a href="#sig-dates-cmt">4.12.2</a>).</li>

&bull;  <b>Merger & acquisition agreements</b> are among the longer ones you'll see, with "Article" and "Section" headings.

<h4 id="preamb-hyp"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.1.</span> Illustration: A hypothetical example</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-preamb-hyp">
<p>
Here's an example of a traditional preamble for a contract, in the usual very-compact form:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org3461483">
<div class="centered" id="org7e05b32">
<p>
<b>Purchase and Sale Agreement</b> <br>
for 2012 MacBook Air Computer
</p>

</div>

<p>
This "<b>Agreement</b>" is between (i) <b>Betty’s Used Computers, LLC</b>, a Texas limited liability company ("<b>Buyer</b>"), with its principal place of business and its initial address for notice at 1234 Main St, Houston, Texas 77002; and (ii) <b>Sam Smythe</b>, an individual residing in Houston, Harris County, Texas, whose initial address for notice is 4604 Calhoun Rd, Houston, Texas 77004 ("<b>Seller</b>"). This Agreement is effective the last date written on the signature page.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Let’s look at this preamble piece by piece: The included information is intended to make life easier on trial counsel if litigation should ever occur.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org982973d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org982973d"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.2.</span> Defining "this Agreement"</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-2">
<p>
Many drafters would <i>repeat</i> the title of the agreement in all-caps in the preamble, thusly: "THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") …." 
</p>

<p>
But a shorter approach might be safer:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="orgc1f75a7">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span> THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") ….
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> This "Agreement" &#x2026;.
</p>

</div>

<p>
This is because: 
</p>

<p>
– It’s doubtful that anyone would be confused about what "This 'Agreement'" refers to; and 
</p>

<p>
– The shorter version reduces the risk that a future editor might (i) revise the title at the very top of the document but (ii) forget to change the title in the preamble. This is an example of the rule of thumb: <b>Don’t Repeat Yourself</b>, or D.R.Y., discussed at <a href="#dont-repeat">32.9</a>.
</p>

<p>
(In the second bullet point just above, notice how the first, long-ish sentence is broken up (i) with bullets, and (ii) with so-called "romanettes," that is, lower-case Roman numerals, to make the sentence easier for a contract reviewer to skim. This follows the maxim: <i>To serve the client, serve the reader</i>.)
</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-org90eeda2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org90eeda2"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.3.</span> Choose shorthand names for the parties, e.g., "Buyer" and "Seller"</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-3">
<p>
<a href="#preamb-hyp">In its preamble</a>, our hypothetical contract defines the terms <i>Buyer</i> and <i>Seller</i> instead of repeatedly the parties’ names, Betty and Sam. 
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org7421173">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span> &#x2026; Betty's Used Computers, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("<b>Betty</b>") &#x2026;.

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> &#x2026; Betty's Used Computers, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("<b>Buyer</b>") &#x2026;.
</p>

</div>


<p>
This is because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Shorthand names for the parties can make it easier on future readers … such as a judge … to keep track of who’s who: Someone scanning the contract "cold" might wonder, "now what's Betty's role in this again?" Calling her <i>Buyer</i> will instantly answer that question.</li>

<li>Shorthand names also make it easier for the drafter to re-use the contract as a starting point for a future deal by just changing the names at the beginning, e.g., changing <i>Betty's Used Computers, LLC</i> to <i>Bob's BBQ Tools, Inc.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
Sure, global search-and-replace can work, but it’s often over-inclusive. For example: Automatically changing all instances of <i>Sam</i> to <i>Sally</i> might result in the word <i>samples</i> being changed to <i>sallyples</i>.

<div id="outline-container-orge81ff9c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge81ff9c"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.4.</span> Defined terms: Bold type, quotation marks, parentheses</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-4">
<p>
In the example above, note how the preamble defines the terms <i>Agreement</i>, <i>Buyer</i>, and <i>Seller</i>: These defined terms are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in bold-faced type;</li>
<li>surrounded by quotation marks; and</li>
<li>in parentheses.</li>
</ul>

<div class="bordered" id="orgaa1c9cc">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span> &#x2026; a Texas limited liability company (Buyer), &#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> &#x2026; a Texas limited liability company ("<b>Buyer</b>"), &#x2026;.
</p>

</div>

<p>
These things help to make the defined terms stand out to a reader who is skimming the document looking for the definition of a particular defined term ("hmm, where did I see that definition of <i>Buyer</i>?").
</p>

<p>
When drafting "in-line" defined terms like this, it’s a good idea to highlight them in this way; this makes it easier for a reader to spot a desired definition quickly when scanning the document to find it.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: If you also have a separate definitions section for defined terms, it’s a good idea for that definitions section to include cross-references to the in-line definitions as well, so that the definitions section serves as a master glossary of all defined terms in the agreement.  (See also <a href="#def-trms-rdg">34.10</a> for more discussion of defined terms.)

<div id="outline-container-org8f7f804" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8f7f804"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.5.</span> The Agreement is "between" the parties</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-5">
<p>
Our preamble says that the contract is <i>between</i> the parties — not <i>by and between</i> the parties, and not <i>among</i> them.
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org2009eb7">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span> This Agreement is by and between &#x2026;. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> This Agreement is between  &#x2026;.
</p>

</div>

<p>
True, many contracts say "by and between" instead of just "between." The former, though, sounds like legalese, and the latter works just as well.
</p>

<p>
For contracts with multiple parties, some drafters will write <i>among</i> instead of <i>between</i>; that’s fine, but <i>between</i> also works.
</p>

<p>
(This is one of those "don't change another party's draft" style points; see <a href="#k-rev-tips">30.11</a>.)

</div>
<div id="outline-container-preamb-org" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="preamb-org"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.6.</span> Preferred: State some details about the parties (in case of litigation)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-preamb-org">
<p>
<a href="#preamb-hyp">Our preamble</a> states certain details about the parties, such as where Betty's Used Computers, LLC is organized (Texas) and Sam's county of residence.
</p>

<p>
When a party to a contract is a corporation, LLC, or other organization, it’s an excellent idea for the preamble to state both:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the type of organization, in this case "a limited liability company"; and</li>

<li>the jurisdiction under whose laws the organization was formed, in this case "organized under the laws of the State of Texas."</li>
</ul>

<p>
Stating these facts in the preamble can provide several benefits:
</p>

<p>
– It reduces the chance of confusion in case the same company name is used by different organizations in different jurisdictions … imagine how many "Acme Corporations" or "AAA Dry Cleaning" there must be in various states.
</p>

<p>
– It helps to nail down at least one jurisdiction where the named party is subject to personal jurisdiction and venue, saving future trial counsel the trouble of proving it up. For example: Sam, our seller, would have a hard time objecting to being sued in Texas, because the preamble recites that he's a resident of Texas.
</p>

<p>
– Moreover: Stating the parties' residences helps to establish whether U.S. federal courts have <i>diversity jurisdiction</i>. (That's a U.S. concept that might or might not be applicable elsewhere.)
</p>

<p>
Some drafters prefer a longer version: 
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org60efabf">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> Betty’s Used Computers, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ….
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> Betty’s Used Computers, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Texas &#x2026;.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Including the jurisdiction of organization can simplify a litigator’s task of "proving up" the necessary facts: If a contract signed by ABC Corporation recites that ABC is a Delaware corporation, for example, then an opposing party generally won’t have to prove that fact; that's because ABC will usually be deemed to have "acknowledged" it (see <a href="#r-ack-defn">2.12.1</a>), that is, stipulated to the fact in advance.
</p>

<p>
This particular hypothetical agreement is set up to be between a limited liability company, or "LLC," and an individual. See <a href="#sig-blocks-cmt">4.12</a> for more about signature blocks for organizations.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org391f71f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org391f71f"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.7.</span> Maybe: Principal place of business and initial notice address</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-7">
<p>
<a href="#preamb-hyp">Our preamble</a> states some geographical information about the parties, with the same goals as stated at <a href="#preamb-org">5.1.6</a> just above:
</p>

<p>
<i>Principal place of business:</i> Stating Betty’s principal place of business helps trial counsel avoid having to prove up the court’s personal jurisdiction and the citizenship of the party for diversity-jurisdiction purposes. For example, a Delaware corporation whose principal place of business was in Houston would almost certainly be subject to suit in state court in Houston.
</p>

<p>
(<b>Note:</b> As discussed at <a href="#nl-prplbus">23.28</a>, the Supreme Court has held that, for purposes of federal diversity jurisdiction, the principal place of business is corporation's "nerve center," that is, "the place where a corporation's officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation's activities," which <i>usually</i> will be the corporation's headquarters. <b>Caution:</b> Conceivably this might not be the case under the law of a given state, e.g., under the state's venue statute establishing where a corporation can be sued in <i>state</i> court as opposed to federal court. )
</p>

<p>
<i>Residence:</i> Likewise, if a party to a contract is an individual, then stating the individual’s residence helps to establish personal jurisdiction over him or her and the proper venue for a lawsuit against the individual.
</p>

<p>
<i>County:</i> Stating the county of an individual’s residence might be important if the city of residence extends into multiple counties. 
</p>

<p>
For example: Houston is the county seat of Harris County. But just because Sam lives in Houston doesn’t automatically mean that he can be sued in the county’s courts in downtown Houston. That’s because Houston’s city limits extend southward into Fort Bend County and northward into Montgomery County. Sam might live in the City of Houston but in one of those other counties, and so he <b>might</b> have to be sued in his home county — e.g., Richmond (Fort Bend County) or Conroe (Montgomery County), vice Houston (Harris County).
</p>

<p>
<i>Initial addresses for notice:</i> It’s convenient to put the parties’ initial addresses for notice in the preamble. That way, a later reader won’t need to go paging through the agreement looking for the notice provision. Doing this also makes it easy for contract reviewer(s) to verify that the information is correct.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org10139a7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org10139a7"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.8.</span> State the effective date in the preamble? (Preferably: No.)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-8">
<p>
The above preamble affirmatively states the effective date; that’s usually unnecessary unless the contract is to be effective <i>as of</i> a specified date. 
</p>

<p>
(Many drafters like to include the effective date anyway; <i>it's normally not worth changing</i> if someone else  has drafted it this way.)
</p>

<p>
The last-date-signed approach:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org01e564b">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> This Agreement is effective the last date written on the signature page.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> This Agreement is made, effective the last date signed as written below, between ….
</p>

</div>

<p>
In reviewing others’ contract drafts, you’re likely to see some less-good possibilities, such as:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org19d7657">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span> This Agreement is <b>made</b> December 31, 20XX &#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> This Agreement is <b>dated</b> December 31, 20XX &#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
<i>(Emphasis added.)</i>
</p>

</div>

<p>
The first, "is made" version above is problematic: What if the parties sign on a different date or dates than December 31? The contract's very first words (after the title) would be a misstatement. At a minimum, it's not a good look; at worst, it could be an intentional attempt at deceptive backdating (see below).
</p>

<p>
The second, "is dated" version above is problematic in a different way: What exactly does it mean to say that a contract is "dated December 31"? You might as well say that the contract "is purple."
</p>

<p>
BUT: When you're reviewing a contract that has the effective date stated in this way, it's a judgment call whether you want to change it — maybe <a href="#partn-r">ask the partner first</a> (<a href="#partn-r">32.10</a>)?

<h4 id="bkdate-cmt-ca"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.9.</span> A <i>contract</i> could be backdated — <i>but <span class="underline">not</span> the signatures</i></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-bkdate-cmt-ca">
<p>
It might be just fine to state that a contract is <i>effective</i> as of a different date than the signature dates.
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org9e987c1">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> This Agreement is made on the last date written on the signature page, but is effective as of <i>[fill in date]</i>.
</p>

</div>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Alice discloses confidential information to Bob after Bob first orally agrees to keep the information confidential; they agree to have the lawyers put together a written confidentiality agreement. That written agreement might state that it is effective as of the date of Alice’s oral disclosure. 
</p>

<p>
(Alice and Bob would not want to backdate their actual signatures, though.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> Never backdate a contract for deceptive purposes, e.g., to be able to book a sale in an earlier period; as discussed at <a href="#sig-date-alice">2.10.5</a>, that practice has sent more than one corporate executive to prison — including at least one giant company's in-house general counsel.

<p>
Some agreements, in identifying the parties to the agreement on the front page, state that the parties are, say, <i>ABC Corporation and its Affiliates</i>. That’s generally a bad idea unless each such affiliate actually signs the agreement as a party and therefore commits on its own to the contractual obligations.

Be sure you’re naming the correct party as "the other side" — or consider negotiating a guaranty (see Protocol <a href="#r-guar-proto">9.5</a>) from a solvent affiliate. 
</p>

<p>
Failing to name the correct corporate entity could leave your client holding the bag. This seems to have happened in a Seventh Circuit case, case, discussed at <a href="#nl-affil-defn-corr-pty">22.1.7.2</a>, where the plaintiff had entered into a contract with what turned out to be a judgment-proof subsidiary of the parent company that it had thought it was dealing with.

In the example signature blocks immediately below, you'll see that the signature blocks are in a table <i>at the front</i> of the agreement — along with the parties' respective initial addresses for notice. This makes the agreement <b>more user-friendly</b>, because:

<ul class="org-ul">

<p>
Also for drafter- and reader convenience: In any contract form, it's never a bad idea to put deal-specific details up front in a "schedule" — which could be thought of as <b>a worksheet</b> for drafting and negotiation. That way:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A drafter using the contract form can change key details by focusing on just the up-front terms in the worksheet.</li>

<li>If a <i>vendor's</i> contract form specifies net-30 payment terms, but the vendor <i>knows</i> that some <i>customers</i> will want longer to pay, then the parties can get to signature sooner if the payment terms are in the worksheet.</li>

<p>
So: Consider putting the details of such terms in a "schedule," either at the front of the document or at the beginning of the clause in question.

<p>
Note to students: Like all purely-style tips, this particular style tip isn't worth making a big deal about if you're reviewing a draft prepared by The Other Side (see <a href="#k-rev-tips">30.11</a>). And if your supervising partner has a preference, then (normally) just do it that way (see <a href="#partn-pref">32.11</a>).
</p>

<p>
Modern contract drafters avoid using the archaic words  "WITNESSETH"  and "Whereas.”  For an example of what <i>not</i> to do, see the following example from a routine <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000114036108012368/ex10_2.htm">commercial real-estate purchase agreement</a>:
</p>

<p>
<b>Don't bother reading the text below</b>, just get a sense of how it looks.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
THIS REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between WIRE WAY, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("Seller"), and RCI HOLDINGS, INC., a Texas corporation ("Purchaser"), pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
</p>

<p>
W I T N E S S E T H:
</p>

<p>
WHEREAS, Seller is the owner of a certain real property consisting of approximately 4.637± acres of land, together with all rights, (excepting for mineral rights as set forth below) , title and interests of Seller in and to any and all improvements and appurtenances exclusively belonging or pertaining thereto (the "Property") located at 10557 Wire Way, Dallas (the "City"), Dallas County, Texas, which Property is more particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference; and
</p>

<p>
WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, North by East Entertainment, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership ("North by East"), is entering into an agreement with RCI Entertainment (Northwest Highway), Inc., a Texas corporation ("RCI Entertainment"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Rick's Cabaret International, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Rick's") for the sale and purchase of the assets of the business more commonly known as "Platinum Club II" that operates from and at the Property ("Asset Purchase Agreement"); and
</p>

<p>
WHEREAS, subject to and simultaneously with the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Seller will enter into a lease with RCI Entertainment, as Tenant, for the Property, dated to be effective as of the closing date, as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Lease") attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by reference; and
</p>

<p>
WHEREAS, subject to the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the execution and acceptance by Seller of the Lease, and pursuant to the terms and provisions contained herein, Seller desires to sell and convey to Purchaser and Purchaser desires to purchase the Property.
</p>

<p>
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and conditions contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree <b>as follows:</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This isn't the easiest to understand.
</p>

<p>
The above example has other problems, in addition to its use of archaic "Whereas" clauses: Because of the "as follows" language at the end of the last paragraph quoted above, it could be argued — which means aggressive counsel might well try to argue — that <i>the parties did not agree</i> to the Whereas clauses.  (This is discussed in more detail at <a href="#recitals-binding">5.3.3</a>.)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-bkgd-stage" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="bkgd-stage"><span class="section-number-4">5.3.2.</span> Use the "Background" section to set the stage</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-bkgd-stage">
<p>
Instead of "Recitals" — or worse yet, W H E R E A S clauses — you're better off describing the background in a (<i>numbered</i>) "Background" section of the contract. 
</p>

<p>
As a general proposition, the Background section should just <b>set up the story</b>: Explain to the future reader, in simple terms — <i>with short sentences and paragraphs</i> — just what the parties are doing, so as to help future readers get up to speed more quickly. 
</p>

<p>
As a horror story, consider the WHEREAS example quoted at <a href="#style-delete-whereas">5.3.1</a> above:  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good luck trying to figure out what's really going on — there <i>seems</i> to be some kind of business roll-up going on, with a sale and leaseback of real estate and maybe other assets, but that's not at all clear.</li>
<li>Now imagine that you're a judge or a judge's law clerk who's trying to puzzle out the story.</li>
<li>Worse: Imagine that you're a juror trying to make sense of this transaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Somewhat better is the following excerpt is from a highly publicized stock purchase agreement in the tech industry, rewritten into background-section form below:
</p>

<p>
BEFORE:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), are entering into a Reorganization Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Reorganization Agreement”), pursuant to which Seller and the Company will complete the Reorganization Transactions at or prior to the Closing; <cite> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1011006/000119312516656039/d178500dex21.htm">Stock Purchase Agreement by and among Yahoo!

<h4 id="recitals-binding"><span class="section-number-4">5.3.3.</span> A contract's background statements <i>might</i> be binding</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-recitals-binding">
<p>
Different jurisdictions might treat background statements differently. For example:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=622.&lawCode=EVID">California Evidence Code § 622</a> provides: "<i>The facts recited in a written instrument are <b>conclusively</b> presumed to be true</i> <b>as between</b> the parties thereto, <b>or their successors</b> in interest; but this rule does not apply to the recital of a consideration." (Emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  BUT: In Maryland: "Contracts often contain recitals: provisions that do not make binding promises but <i>merely recite background information about factual context</i> or the parties' intentions. Maryland law recognizes the general principle that <i>such recitals are not binding</i> and, while they may aid the court in interpreting the contract's operative terms, cannot displace or supplement operative terms that are clear." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14376974568746993070">Sprint Nextel Corp. v. Wireless Buybacks Holdings, LLC</a>, 938 F.3d 113, 127 (4th Cir. 2019) (vacating and remanding partial summary judgment) (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
And in a 2022 decision, the Court of Federal Claims observed:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
<i>Whereas clauses <b>are not contractual</b>; they are recitations laying out the background understandings of the parties</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Thus, in the face of ambiguity, they may be used to interpret the meaning the parties attached to the operative words.
</p>

<p>
But they can do even more. They tell us the assumed facts and purposes of the parties. Rather than only coming into play given ambiguous language, they also may be considered in determining whether language is clear in the first place. But what they may not do is create ambiguity where the words have only one permissible meaning. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7819678961711935746">THR Enterpr., Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-bkgd-stmt-intent">
<p>
A naked statement of <i>one party's</i> subjective intent in entering into the contract might not bind another party. EXAMPLE: That happened in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14376974568746993070">Sprint Nextel</a>, in which:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The cell-phone service provider offered "upgraded" phones to its customers at steep discounts when customers renewed their contracts — the discounts were so steep that the customers paid less than what the phones would bring on the used-phone market.</li>

<li>Seeing a business opportunity, another company, Wireless Buybacks, bought upgraded phones from Sprint customers and resold them at a profit.</li>

<li>Sprint sued Wireless Buybacks for tortious interference with Sprint's contracts with its customers; Sprint claimed that its customer contract prohibited resale because it said in part: "Our rate plans, customer devices, services and features <i>are not for resale</i> and are intended for reasonable and non-continuous use by a person using a device on Sprint's networks." (Emphasis added.)</li>

<li>The trial court found that this language unambiguously barred resale of the phones by Sprint customers; the court granted partial summary judgment for Sprint.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On appeal, however, the Fourth Circuit held that the contract language "is <b>a background statement of intent, not an enforceable promise</b> not to resell Sprint phones." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14376974568746993070">Sprint Nextel Corp. v.

<h4 id="bkgd-no-subst"><span class="section-number-4">5.3.5.</span> Don't put rights & obligations in the Background</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-bkgd-no-subst">
<p>
Inexperienced contract drafters will sometimes put specific rights and/or obligations in a Background section. That's a bad idea for the reasons discussed above.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     <i>Example 1:</i> One of the author's students once wrote <i>in the Background section</i>:  "For all purposes, the Data is owned by Client and is provided to Contractor for completion of services under this Agreement."   
</p>

<p>
COMMENT: This shouldn't go into the Background section, but instead in a substantive section, for example in a section about ownership of intellectual property.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     <i>Example 2:</i> Another student wrote: "Client will pay Contractor as stated in this Agreement." 
</p>

<p>
COMMENT: This shouldn't be in the Background section, because the payment provisions would (or at least should) speak for themselves — moreover, readers would naturally <i>assume</i> that Client would pay Contractor, so there was no need to include that fact <i>in the Background section</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     <i>Example 3:</i> Still another student wrote: "The parties have agreed that Client will compensate Provider with a flat monthly fee of $20,000 for up to 200 staff hours of work per month, with additional work hours being billed at $150 per hour."  
</p>

<p>
COMMENT:  This would work <i>only if</i> the Background section was the only place that the specific compensation details were discussed, so as not to violate the D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) guideline discussed at <a href="#dont-repeat">32.9</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     <i>Example 4:</i> A student wrote: "Client and Service Provider enter into the Agreement for the term of one year from the effective date of the Agreement." 
</p>

<p>
COMMENT:  This is another item that would go into a substantive provision further down in the contract, not into the Background section.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-bkgd-student">
<p>
<i>Note to students: This section will give you an idea of some minor errors that can arise in drafting a background section.</i>
</p>

<p>
1.  A student used "WHEREAS" several times.  
</p>

<p>
COMMENT:  That's OK if the partner wants it, but it's archaic.
</p>

<p>
2.  A student described one of the parties, "Mary" (the CEO of our hypothetical MathWhiz LLC)  as an "expert." 
</p>

<p>
COMMENT:  Not a great idea (for Mary): The other side might argue later that Mary <i>had held herself</i> out as an expert when she really wasn't, and that this supposedly constituted fraud in the inducement.
</p>

<p>
3.  Several students wrote variations on, e.g., "Gigunda desires for MathWhiz to analyze data, and MathWhiz desires to do so."   
</p>

<p>
COMMENT:  Not the best phrasing, because the rest of the contract can speak for itself — and in any case, <b>the parties' <i>subjective</i> desires</b> don't enter into contract interpretation except in cases of a lack of meeting of the minds or mutual mistake.

<p>
Letter agreements can be useful as binding contracts because they're (often) simpler yet still get the job done. That can sometimes be appealing to business people, who aren't fond of spending time negotiating traditional contract language.
</p>

<p>
<b>Employment agreements</b> are often done as offer letters; see, e.g., <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512046715/d287954dex107.htm">Sheryl Sandberg's employment agreement at Facebook</a>. (Students: We'll be studying portions of this agreement during the semester.) Likewise was the <a href="https://contracts.onecle.com/ford/bond-consulting-2006-09-13.shtml">2006 letter agreement</a> for consulting services between Ford Motor Company and British financial wizard Sir John Bond; it consisted of an introduction, six bullet points, and a closing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="org337d52e"></a> <b>A four-sentence NDA letter agreement:</b> In the early 1980s I was a fairly-new associate at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howrey">Arnold, White & Durkee</a>, then one of the largest IP-litigation firms in the United States. One day, Tom Arnold, the senior name partner, assigned me to draft a confidentiality agreement (commonly known as a "nondisclosure agreement, or "NDA") for a friend of his, "Bill," who was going to be disclosing a business plan to Bill’s friend "Jim."  <aside> A personal note: <a href="https://www.chron.com/business/article/Tom-Arnold-intellectual-property-law-pioneer-1747187.php">Tom Arnold</a> (1923-2009) founded the law firm Arnold, White & Durkee, which grew to become what we think was the second-largest intellectual property boutique in the United States, with some 150 lawyers in six cities across the country. "TA," as we referred to him, was everything a lawyer should be; multiple lawyers outside the firm told me that Tom was very likely the best-known IP attorney in the world. For many years Tom and his wife, Grace Gordon Arnold (1926-2015), were very good to my wife and me; I'm proud to have been Tom's law partner and friend. </aside>
</p>

<p>
Tom always thought in practical terms, aiming to figure out the best, most cost-effective way to achieve what the client <i>really</i> needed and wanted. Probably not coincidentally, during World War II Tom had served as a Navy officer aboard a battleship and an aircraft carrier — a role in which real-world pragmatism is prized.
</p>

<p>
For this NDA project, Tom instructed me <i>not</i> to draft a conventional contract for his friend. Instead, the NDA was to take the form of a short letter. I don't remember exactly what my draft said, but it was along approximately the following lines:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org648ef8f">
<p>
Dear Jim,
</p>

<p>
This confirms that I will be telling you about my plans to go into business <i>[raising tribbles, let's say]</i> so that you can evaluate whether you want to invest in the business with me. 
</p>

<p>
You agree that unless I say it's OK, you won’t disclose what I tell you about my plans to anyone else, and you won’t use that information yourself for any other purpose. 
</p>

<p>
You won't be under this obligation, though, to the extent that the information in question has become public, or if you get the information from another legitimate source.
</p>

<p>
If this is agreeable, please countersign the enclosed copy of this letter and return it to me. I look forward to our working together.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely yours,
</p>

<p>
Bill
</p>

</div>

<p>
When I’d prepared a draft, I showed it to Tom and asked him, <i>um, isn’t this pretty sparse?</i> Tom agreed that yes, it was sparse — <b>but</b>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The signed letter would be a <i>binding, enforceable</i> contract: Bill could use the letter to go to court — and get to a jury — <span class="underline">if</span> his friend Jim breached it, which both Bill and Tom judged to be a very low risk.</li>

<li>Equally important to Bill: <i>Jim would probably sign the letter immediately</i> because as an experienced businessman, Jim would quickly recognize the letter as a reasonable NDA — plus, he had reason to trust that his friend Bill wouldn't try to take advantage of him.</li>

<li>On the other hand, if Bill had asked Jim to sign a conventionally-drafted confidentiality agreement, full of typical legalese, then Jim likely would have asked his lawyer to review the agreement, "just to be on the safe side, y'know?"</li>

<li>And if Jim's lawyer <span class="underline">had</span> gotten involved, that would have delayed things — not just by the amount of time it took Jim's lawyer to review the agreement, but for the parties to negotiate any changes that Jim's lawyer might have requested, because lawyers so often spot things that supposedly "need" changing &#x2026;.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That early experience was an eye-opener: It showed that contracts aren’t magical written incantations — they’re just <b>simple statements of simple things.</b>
</p>

<p>
The experience was also a lesson in a fundamental truth: <b>Business clients are often far more interested in being able to sign an "OK" contract ASAP</b> — accepting that it will entail what they judge to be an acceptable business risk — than they are in signing a theoretically-better contract, but having to wait around to do so.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Pathclearer letter-agreement  approach.</b> <a id="org72021b8"></a> A similar approach to getting to signature quickly, for low-risk business contracts, was dubbed "<a href="https://www.oncontracts.com/docs/Pathclearer_article_reduced_size.pdf">Pathclearer</a>" by the in-house counsel who developed it at Scottish & Newcastle, a brewery in the UK. That approach entailed the following: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use short letter agreements instead of long contracts, and</li>

<li>Rely on the general law and commercial motivations — i.e., each party's ability to walk away, coupled with <i>each party's desire to keep working with a proven-good supplier or customer</i> — to fill in any remaining gaps in coverage. <cite> See Steve Weatherley, <a href="https://www.oncontracts.com/docs/Pathclearer_article_reduced_size.pdf">Pathclearer: A more commercial approach to drafting commercial contracts</a>, Practical L.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-eml-k">
<p>
Some might be surprised that in the United States (and the UK, and probably other jurisdictions), you can form a legally-binding contracts <i>by exchanging emails</i>. A number of examples are listed in the footnote — <b>students,</b> you can just scan the list for general familiarity; you <span class="underline">won't</span> be tested on the details.<sup><a id="fnr.EmailK" class="footref" href="#fn.EmailK" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Moreover, an email exchange could serve to evidence a binding <i>oral</i> contract, even if the emails didn't in themselves establish the existence of a contract — assuming of course that the oral contract wasn't barred by the Statute of Frauds (recapped at <a href="#stat-frauds">34.34</a>). <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1265377823722656406">Gibson Foundation, Inc. v. Norris</a>, No. 24-1763 (1st Cir. Nov. 20, 2025) (affirming judgment on jury verdict that a rhinestone-adorned piano that had belonged to flamboyant entertainer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberace">Liberace</a> had been loaned — not gifted — to a pianist); <i>cf.</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10551638775601644470">Nusbaum v. E-Lo Sportswear LLC</a>, No. 17-cv-3646 (KBF), slip op. at 9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2017) (granting former employee's motion for summary judgment; emails established meeting of the minds). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Of course, an email exchange wouldn't create a binding contract if the <i>content</i> of the emails failed to meet the usual requirements of establishing a meeting of the minds on all material terms, consideration, and an agreement to be bound (see § <a href="#contract-rqmts">34.28</a>). BUT: If your client is intending <i>not</i> to be bound, then it's best to encourage the client to stay well away from the edge of the cliff — e.g., by including "this isn't binding!" language such as that of § <a href="#loi-bind-when">4.6.2</a> in Protocol <a href="#r-LOIRule">4.6</a> (letters of intent).

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-2-2-1">
<p>
Email contracts can be especially useful when the  parties are mainly interested in having <i>something</i> in writing. EXAMPLE: A client of mine and one of its customer agreed on terms for a small matter. Let's call my client "MathWhiz" and the customer "Gigunda," to conform to our class hypothetical. The parties "signed" the final, negotiated version of a contract by email. They were willing to do this because it was a small matter and the parties' relevant business people had previously worked together while employed by other companies.
</p>

<p>
Here's how we did it:
</p>

<p>
<i>Step 1:</i> Gigunda's in-house lawyer, "Gina," and I agreed to a final draft of the contract. I saved the final draft as a PDF.
</p>

<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> With Gina's prior concurrence, I sent the following email to the pre-designated executives of each company — "Mary" for my client MathWhiz and "George" for Gigunda. Of course I copied Gina (Gigunda's lawyer), along with some other business people involved in the negotiation to keep them in the loop. <aside> Concerning lawyers copying The Other Side's business people on emails, see § <a href="#LawyerCopyEmails">3.9.2</a> of Protocol <a href="#r-lawyer-involve">3.9</a> (lawyer involvement). </aside>
</p>

<p>
Here’s the text of my email, lightly edited — the first line below is the subject line:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
SIGNATURE REQUEST: Gigunda-MathWhiz Project Agreement
</p>

<p>
MARY and GEORGE: Per Gina's’s email (below), please do a Reply to All with the text "Agreed" to confirm that MathWhiz and Gigunda and have agreed to the attached Project Agreement, reflecting agreed revisions.
</p>

<p>
GINA: As previously discussed by email, the attachment is a PDF of the redline that you sent on Sept. XX, with no other changes <i>[see the "Pro tip" below]</i>, and with the redlines left in place so that Mary can see the agreed variations from MathWhiz's standard agreement form.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;DC
</p>

<p>
[my signature block]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> Mary and George promptly emailed back "Agreed." Under the law pretty much everywhere in the U.S. (see the citations in the preceding footnotes), this created a binding contract — and the parties didn’t have to go to the trouble of wet-ink signature, nor did they have to use a document-signature service.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> Note that in my email above, I proactively confirmed to Gigunda's lawyer Gina that I’d made no other changes to the draft that the customer’s lawyer and I had agreed on. This small professional courtesy helps speed up the signature process, because one lawyer will generally take another lawyer's word for something like this. (BUT: If the occasion offers, ask me in class about a somewhat-embarrassing situation that happened to me as a new lawyer.)

<h5 id="orgfc9343f"><span class="section-number-5">6.2.2.2.</span> Downsides of emails as contracts</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-2-2-2">
<p>
Email exchanges don't seem to be used as contracts very often in practice. There are a couple of possible reasons for that.
</p>

<p>
1.  First, parties often neglect to file emails in an organized fashion. If that happened with an email contract, a party might forget about the contract.
</p>

<p>
2.  And if a party forgot about an email-exchange contract, then perhaps one day the party might find itself:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in breach of the contract — and ambushed by the other party's claim for damages; and/or</li>

<li>not claiming a benefit, and perhaps losing the benefit as a result (e.g., if there was a contractual deadline).</li>
</ul>

<p>
3.  Finally, parties (and lawyers) often prefer the comfort of having a separate, signed document that <i>looks</i> like a contract.
</p>

<p>
So: Parties often prefer contracts to be a bit more formal. BUT: As we saw in the real-world MathWhiz and Gigunda example above, parties might still be willing to use an email exchange as "the contract" in a transaction where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No one expects the transaction to be a big deal.</li>

<li>The parties want <i>something</i> in writing "just in case."</li>

<li>The parties don't want to spend a lot of time or money on a traditional contract.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="eml-sig"><span class="section-number-5">6.2.2.3.</span> Signatures on email contracts</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-eml-sig">
<p>
For an email exchange to form a binding contract, the emails must include "signatures" for each party. Those can (usually) take the form of <b>email signature blocks</b>, and even <b>names in email "From" fields</b>. <cite> For an extensive discussion of authority on this point, see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8950413742387440987">Khoury v. Tomlinson</a>, 518 S.W.3d 568, 575-77 (Tex. App. [1st Dist.] 2017, no pet.) (holding that "from" field sufficed as a signature but reversing and remanding on other grounds). One court held that a "from" field <i>can</i> suffice as a signature, but also held that on the particular facts of that case, the "from" field in the email in question did <i>not</i> act as a signature for an attached document (and also that the parties had not agreed to transact their business electronically). See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8771334879485786502">SN4, LLC v. Anchor Bank, FSB</a>, 848 N.W.2d 559 (Minn. App. 2014). </cite>

<p>
DCT comment: Because of the established law discussed above, I've long included a disclaimer in email signature blocks; at this writing (mid-2025), the disclaimer reads as follows:

<h4 id="k-im"><span class="section-number-4">6.2.3.</span> Text-message conversations: Binding?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-k-im">
<p>
Even a very-terse exchange of text messages or instant messages ("IM") <i>can</i> create a binding contract, <b>if</b> the exchange would otherwise qualify as such.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: An IM exchange between a digital ad agency and an electronic cigarette manufacturer served as a binding agreement to increase the ad a gency's budget for placing online ads for the e-cigarettes. The crux of the IM exchange started with a message from an account executive at the ad agency: "We can do 2000 [ad placement] orders/day by Friday if I have your blessing." The manufacturer's VP of advertising responded: "NO LIMIT." The account executive responded: "awesome!" That series of messages served to modify the parties' contract — as a result, the manufacturer had to pay the ad agency more than a million dollars in additional fees. <cite> See <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-flsd-0_09-cv-62020/pdf/USCOURTS-flsd-0_09-cv-62020-0.pdf">CX Digital Media, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
BUT: A text-message or IM conversation won't be binding as a contract if the usual prerequisites aren't met — e.g., offer, acceptance, consideration. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6569995928769204216">iWTNS, Inc. v.

<b>Caution:</b> When it comes to real-estate contracts, California's version of the Statute of Frauds <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1624">states that</a>: "An electronic message of an ephemeral nature <i>that is not designed to be retained or to create a permanent record</i>, including, but not limited to, a text message or instant message format communication, <i>is insufficient</i> under this title to constitute a contract to convey real property, in the absence of a written confirmation that conforms to the requirements of <i>[citation omitted]</i>." <cite> <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1624.">Cal.

<p>
The Eighth Circuit once observed that "Texas law permits contracts that set the guidelines for future agreements to become enforceable at the point that those future contracts are created. These contracts are not binding alone, but set out the rules of the game in the event the parties decide to play ball. They are valid and enforceable under Texas laws, so long as the parties enter into the agreements contemplated in the original contract." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8807640961644488806">J.V. & Sons Trucking, Inc. v.

In a Michigan case, an individual filled out an employment application.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-loi-gf-a">
<p>
Business people and drafters can sometimes be tempted to say, in a contract, "we haven't agreed on this yet, <i>but we'll negotiate it in good faith</i>." (That might be especially likely if the issue in question hasn't yet come up, e.g., a future contingency of some kind.) <b>Agreements to negotiate in good faith are generally enforceable</b> under U.S. law. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=25671195402452395">Cox Communications, Inc. v. T-Mobile US, Inc.</a>, 273 A.3d 752, 764 & n.81 (Del. 2022): "Delaware law recognizes that obligations to negotiate in good faith are not worthless." </cite>
</p>

<p>
Agreements to negotiation in good faith fall in the category that Delaware law recognizes as a "Type II" preliminary agreement:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Type I agreements are firm obligations where the parties agree on all terms and contemplate memorializing the agreement in a formal document, while Type II agreements reflect the parties' <b>commitment to negotiate together in good faith</b> in an effort to reach final agreement within the scope that has been settled in the preliminary agreement. <cite> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/24-2794/24-2794-2025-12-23.html">37celsius Capital Partners, L.P. v.

<p>
Business people and drafters can sometimes be tempted to say, in a contract, "we don't know what we want to do about Issue X, so we'll leave that for later." That might, <i>or might not</i>, cause problems later.  
</p>

<p>
In U.S. jurisdictions, an "agreement to agree" in a contract is not enforceable. 
</p>

<p>
BUT: That's distinct from the situation in which a contract is materially complete but has "open terms" that a court can readily calculate or discern; in the latter situation, the contract <i>is</i> enforceable if it otherwise qualifies as such under the law, e.g., the Statute of Frauds (recapped at <a href="#stat-frauds">34.34</a>). <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10362170789260437550">Bich v.

<p>
Relatedly: A statement in a contract that something will happen later "only after" the parties "mutually agree" on something is likely to be held a condition precedent — i.e., a prerequisite — and not an unenforceable agreement to agree nor an agreement to <a href="#loi-gf-a">negotiate in good faith</a>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15148613809188075951">Endeavor Natural Gas III, LLC v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-po-paper-flow">
<p>
When a corporate customer makes a significant purchase, it's essentially a universal practice for the customer's procurement people to send the vendor a purchase order. Typically, the customer insists that the vendor's invoice must include the purchase-order number — if the invoice doesn't have a PO number, then the customer's accounts-payable department generally just won't pay the invoice.  These are routine internal-controls measures for customers; they're almost-uniformly implemented by customers to help prevent fraud.
</p>

<p>
Often (but not always) the customer's purchase order will have been preceded by the vendor's sending the customer a sales quotation proposing to sell specific goods and/or services, at a stated price, with stated delivery terms.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl- object-terms">
<p>
When a customer sends a purchase order to a vendor, the purchase-order form might well include legal fine print added by the customers lawyers. Those lawyers want to protect their client as much as possible, so they can be inclined to load the document with terms and conditions. In a customer's PO, the legal fine print might include, e.g.:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>expansive vendor warranties;</li>

<li>long statute-of-limitations provisions;</li>

<li>onerous indemnity requirements;</li>

<li>various "acknowledgements" (see <a href="#r-ack-defn">2.12.1</a>) to give the customer leverage over the vendor in litigation (and thus in settlement negotiations);</li>
</ul>

<p>
and so on. <cite> See, e.g., a Honeywell purchase-order form archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/CUV6-NKTY">https://perma.cc/CUV6-NKTY</a>. For a customer-oriented checklist of "gap-filler" PO terms that vendors might find objectionable — which would often lead to time-consuming negotiations and delays — see Stephen Gillen, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ai-and-your-purchase-order-form-9078046">AI and Your Purchase Order Form</a> (JDSupra.com 2025). </cite>
</p>

<p>
And vendors aren't always innocent parties in this little dance; oh, no. It's not uncommon for a vendor's initial sales quotation (inviting a purchase order) to state that all customer orders are subject to acceptance in writing by the vendor. Then, when the customer does send a purchase order, the vendor responds with a written "order confirmation." Often, the order confirmation that itself contains detailed terms and conditions — some of which might directly conflict with the terms in the customer's purchase order. <cite> See, e.g., a Honeywell terms-of-<i>sale</i> document archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/5MB9-H6VK">https://perma.cc/5MB9-H6VK</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Even vendor <i>invoices</i> might contain terms and conditions that the vendor might try to assert someday as constituting the contract — even though the customer might reasonably counter that "the contract" was formed and its terms locked in — long before the vendor sent its invoice. <aside> In the same vein, lawyers of a certain age working in the computer industry will remember the "shrinkwrap license agreement" cases of the 1990s and early 2000s. The nadir of those cases arguably came in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4445746745575023652">Hill v. Gateway 2000, Inc.</a>, 105 F.3d 1147 (7th Cir. 1997) (Easterbrook, J.) (vacating and remanding district court's refusal to compel arbitration): The court held that a consumer who bought a computer by mail was bound by an arbitration provision included in terms and conditions <i>that were printed on a card inside the box</i>. because the consumer had not exercised the stated right to return the product in case of disagreement. See also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11811009805458694240">ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg</a>, 86 F.3d 1447, 1450 (7th Cir. 1996) (Easterbrook, J.) (reversing district court: software license terms were enforceable when software package, sold in stores, included external notice stating that software came with license restrictions).  </aside>

<div id="outline-container-po-reject" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="po-reject"><span class="section-number-4">6.7.3.</span> Pro tip: Reject the other side's fine-print terms?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-po-reject">
<p>
A customer's purchase order will often reject any terms in the vendor's order confirmations, invoices, etc. (You'll remember from the 1L Contracts course that <i>A</i>'s rejection of <i>B</i>'s offer means that no contract is formed on the offer.) Similarly, vendors' sales quotes, order confirmations, etc., often reject the customer's purchase-order terms. In effect, these rejections say, <i>only <span class="underline">our</span> terms and conditions will apply, sport — <span class="underline">your</span> terms won't count, no matter what happens.</i> <cite> Both of the above-cited Honeywell forms include such rejection language. </cite>
</p>

<p>
This kind of language is motivated by section 2-206 of the (U.S.) Uniform Commercial Code. That section states, in part, that for sales of goods:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
(1) <i>Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language</i> or circumstances[,] (a) an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances &#x2026;. <cite> <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-206">UCC § 2-206</a> (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
<b>Lesson:</b> Drafters asked to prepare standard forms of this kind should strongly consider whether to include "We reject <i>your</i> terms!" language along these lines.

<h4 id="nl-battle-forms-drop-out"><span class="section-number-4">6.7.4.</span> Battle of the Forms:  When each party's paper rejects the other's terms</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-battle-forms-drop-out">
<p>
In real-world dealings, what practical impact will result from these <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/295674/origin-of-i-fart-in-your-general-direction">Pythonesque</a> statements in parties' transaction paper? This is important because <b>the parties' <i>people</i> might not even notice</b> the legal fine print in these dueling forms. Instead, what could easily happen is something like the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The vendor's sales people <b>process the purchase order</b> and send it to the order-fullfilment department.</li>
<li>The vendor's order-fulfillment department <b>ships the ordered goods</b> — along with a confirmation of sale document and an invoice.</li>
<li>The customer's receiving department <b>takes delivery</b> of the ordered goods and puts them into inventory, distributes them to end users, or whatever.</li>
<li>The customer's receiving department forwards the vendor's invoice to the customer's accounts-payable department, which in due course <b>pays the invoice</b>.</li>
<li>Neither party signs the other's paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So whose terms and conditions will govern — those of the customer, or those of the vendor? Neither has agreed to the other's terms and conditions. But clearly the parties have conducted themselves <i>as though</i> they had a contract. 
</p>

<p>
This sort of situation is known as the "Battle of the Forms." It's expressly contemplated by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-207">UCC § 2-207</a>. (It's sometimes experienced in common-law situations as well.)
</p>

<p>
Under the "Drop-Out Rule" in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-207">UCC § 2-207(3)</a>, <i>when the parties are <a href="#nl-merchant-defn">merchants</a></i> (see <a href="#nl-merchant-defn">15.5</a>):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>whatever terms are common to the parties' respective contract forms is part of "the contract"</li>
<li>all other terms in both parties' contract forms drop out — left on the cutting-room floor, if you will; and</li>
<li>the UCC's gap-filler terms also apply.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Before we look at the text of the Drop-Out Rule, it might be helpful to study this Venn diagram of how the Rule works:
</p>

<p>
<br/>And now here's the text of UCC § 2-207(3):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
(3) <b>Conduct</b> by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although <b>the writings</b> of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. <b>In such case</b> the terms of the particular contract consist of[:] [i] those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with [ii] any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this Act. <cite> Emphasis and bracketed text added; see generally the discussion of the "Battle of the Forms" by <a href="https://thecontractsguy.net/2012/03/01/battle-of-the-forms-explained-using-a-few-short-words/">Brian Rogers</a> at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BattleFormsBrianRogers">https://tinyurl.com/BattleFormsBrianRogers</a>, along with his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190112063847/http://picjur.com/2010/03/battle-of-the-forms/">diagram</a> at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BattleFormsDiagram">https://tinyurl.com/BattleFormsDiagram</a>. </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
So: In our hypothetical situation above, our parties have engaged in conduct that recognizes the existence of a contract: Goods have been ordered, delivered, and paid for. Under the Drop-Out Rule, the terms of the parties' contract are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>whatever "matching" terms exist in the parties' respective forms, <i>plus</i></li>
<li>the UCC's default provisions.</li>

It'd be a very-different analysis of the Battle of the Forms under the <a href="http://cisgw3.law.pace.edu/cisg/text/treaty.html">UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods</a> (UN CISG) The CISG follows the so-called "last shot" rule, which the Seventh Circuit summarized as: "The terms of the contract are those embodied in the last offer (or counteroffer) made prior to a contract being formed." The court affirmed a judgment below that "because Illinois Trading never expressly assented to the attorney's fees provision in VLM's trailing invoices, under the Convention that term did not become a part of the parties' contracts. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10106132911525772322">VLM Food Trading Int'l, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2.a: Any <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bigfour.asp">Big Four accounting firm</a> would typically be considered a reasonable choice for auditors (as long as not paid on a contingent fee basis), but they don't come cheap.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivisions 2.b and 3: Contingent-fee auditors would have a financial incentive to err on the side of "finding" errors. This could be especially problematic if the auditors' findings were agreed to be binding. Moreover <i>disputes</i> about a contingent-fee auditor's findings likely would be expensive and time-consuming for all concerned.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp;  <i>Danger of in-house auditors?</i> Often, employees of the Auditing Party and its affiliates might <i>not</i> be considered reasonable auditors — but the Rec&shy;ord&shy;keep&shy;er should consider agreeing anyway, to help keep costs down, because the Auditing Party might not want to bear the expense of having an outside auditor do the job, and instead might prefer to send in one of its own employees to "look at the books."

E.&nbsp; <i>Use the Rec&shy;ord&shy;keep&shy;er's own auditor?</i> Contracts consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-tracy-04a28923">John Tracy</a> once suggested, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4036673/4036673-6176029012763164676">LinkedIn discussion thread</a> (membership required), that an auditing party should consider engaging the outside CPA firm that regularly audits the recordkeeping party's books. John says that this should reduce the cost of the audit and assuage the recordkeeping party's concerns about audit confidentiality; he also says that "the independent CPA will act independently rather than risk the loss of their <i>[sic]</i> license and accreditation and get sued for malpractice."

<p>
A.&nbsp; Apropos of the exclusive-remedy provision (§ <a href="#audit-true-excl">9.1.20</a>): In an "ordinary" audit, the whole point is to find and fix deficiencies, so an audit will usually end with a true-up to remedy any discrepancies revealed by the audit. But sometimes an audit will reveal things such as intentional overbilling that amounts to fraud. EXAMPLE: A trucking company, over the course of three years, submitted 645 fraudulent invoices to a customer, accompanied by forged emails that supposedly showed pre-approval by the customer. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12649791277778007013">Contitech USA v. McLaughlin Freight Services, Inc.</a>, 91 F.4th 908, 911 (8th Cir. 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
In fraud cases like that, a true-up shouldn't be the exclusive remedy because that would create "<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moralhazard.asp">moral hazard</a>," i.e., an incentive for a party to roll the dice and engage in fraudulent behavior because the fraud might never be detected and the only downside would be to have to pay what you owe anyway.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; As an example of moral hazard, here's a situation that can arise in enterprise software license agreements with unlimited use rights:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Instead of buying licenses for a fixed number of employees to use the software (for example), the customer is free to allow as many of its employees to use the software as desired.
</p>

<p>
(Software could also be licensed based on other metrics, e.g., the number of transactions processed, the number of machine installations, etc.)
</p></li>

<li>Periodically, e.g., quarterly, the customer does a true-up: The customer reports its software usage to the vendor and pays the agreed license fee for any new users.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes, though, the customer will <i>intentionally</i> underreport its software usage and underpay the license fees — which cheats the vendor out of legitimate revenue. That's why some software vendors periodically audit their customers to enforce the license payment terms. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/pricing/olsa-ire-v122304-070683.pdf#page=4.52">Oracle License and Services Agreement</a> paragraph O; <a href="https://scottandscottllp.com/top-three-revisions-to-request-in-software-license-audit-clauses/">Barnett</a> (2015). </cite>
</p>

<p>
In such a situation, without an exclusive-remedy limitation of liability, the vendor might want to be free to demand a greater measure of damages for the discrepancy revealed by the auditor's report if that were available by law — such as indirect damages resulting from copyright infringement if the audit showed that the Rec&shy;ord&shy;keep&shy;er had used licensed software for more than it had paid for. (See also the related commentary at <a href="#nl-pmt-late-not-infr">9.9.8.15</a> concerning whether late payment could be regarded as infringement.)

•  As reported in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/usa-today-owner-gannett-co-gave-advertisers-inaccurate-information-for-nine-months-11646784745?mod=djemalertNEWS">Wall Street Journal</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Publishing company Gannett Co. provided inaccurate information to advertisers for nine months, misrepresenting where billions of ads were placed, according to researchers who provided their findings exclusively to The Wall Street Journal. &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
* * * 
</p>

<p>
In another example observed by a Wall Street Journal reporter, Capital One and American Red Cross bought ads that seemed as though they would appear on the Sarasota Herald-Tribune website, based on the information provided in the real-time auction. In fact, the ads ran on the website of Ruidoso News, a biweekly newspaper in New Mexico. 
</p>

<p>
An American Red Cross spokeswoman said the organization was unaware of the issue.
</p>

<p>
Capital One didn’t respond to a request for comment.

<p>
•  As reported in the New York Times: A woman was convicted of fraud for providing fake customer lists to JPMorgan Chase while selling her financial-aid startup company to the bank; she was sentenced to 85 months in federal prison. "Though the bank eventually pieced together the scheme after conducting its tests, its due diligence team failed to sniff out the fraud during the acquisition." <cite> Ron Lieber, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/business/charlie-javice-sentence.html?unlocked_article_code=1.2U8.RU1t.VsKdzr_cps-1&smid=url-share">Charlie Javice Sentenced to 85 Months in Prison for Fraud</a> (NYTimes.com Sept. 29, 2025) (gift article).] Another observer noted: "JPMorgan enacted a third-party marketing company to verify <i>[the startup company's]</i> user data, but the third-party company primarily counted data fields instead of authenticating actual users." <cite> Abbie Staiger, <a href="https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=jpmorgan-175-million-dollar-due-diligence-error-charlie-javice">Learning from JPMorgan's $175M Due Diligence Error</a> (AFCE.com 2025). </cite>
</p>

<p>
And there was a knock-on effect: JPMorgan found itself being billed for some $60 million for the woman's legal fees — as the NY Times also reported: "JPMorgan said in a filing last month that Ms. Javice engaged five separate law firms, and that she and her lawyers have treated the original ruling forcing the bank to pay for her defense as a 'blank check to bill and expense whatever they please.' The stable of lawyers that she has used have also represented Elon Musk, Harvey Weinstein and Sam Bankman-Fried."  <cite> Ron Lieber, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/business/charlie-javice-jpmorgan-legal-bills.html?unlocked_article_code=1.1U8.cdob.8xD17BBNY2QR&smid=url-share">She Took JPMorgan for $175 Million. That Doesn’t Include Her Restaurant Bills.</a> (NYTimes.com Nov. 14, 2025) (gift article).] (Anticipating just this possibility, § <a href="#def-ctrl">16.1.4</a> of {{{NAME Protocol <a href="#r-defend-defn">16.1</a> (Defense Against Claims Procedure Protocol) gives <i>the defending party</i> the right to control the defense.)

In a 2003 article, fraud examiner Craig Green <a href="http://www.acfe.com/article.aspx?id=4294967859">lists a number of things</a> that such folks often look for, including, for example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>cheating on shipments of goods, e.g., by shorting goods or sending the wrong ones;</li>

<li>Was the Bank was located somewhere that it wouldn't be a huge pain for the Biller to sue the Bank for payment if necessary?</li>

The consequences of a <i>material</i> breach of contract can be significant; moreover, courts will generally defer to a contract's explicit statement that a particular type of breach would be "material," as discussed in more detail at Protocol <a href="#r-termin-breach">20.6</a>. For that reason, the Biller might want the Payer to stipulate that the Payer's breach of its backup-payment obligations would indeed be material — thus giving the Biller a bit more leverage over the Payer in case of difficulties. </aside>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-bkup-pmt-ex">
<p>
In some deals, a party's prospect of <i>not</i> getting paid can be a non-trivial risk:
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: At the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, Walmart entered into a "Supply Agreement" — basically, a framework agreement or master purchase agreement — with a company called K7. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Under the Supply Agreement, Walmart placed successive orders adding up to millions of bottles worth of hand sanitizer in bottles.</li>

<li>At first, Walmart "collected" the orders from K7's warehouse, as called for in the Supply Agreement, and paid K7 for them.</li>

<li>But as consumer demand tapered off, Walmart started failing both to pick up the orders — leaving K7's warehouse bulging with bottles — and also to pay K7 for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
K7 sued Walmart for breach of contract. Walmart defended by claiming that the Supply Agreement didn't provide a quantity or price and so was unenforceable. The jury disagreed and awarded K7 more than $7 million; the Eighth Circuit affirmed judgment for that amount plus prejudgment interest and costs. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16616543305948878900">K7 Design Grp, Inc. v. Walmart, Inc</a>., 143 F.4th 931 (8th Cir. Jul. 11, 2025) <i>affirming</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17413448075781861651">No. 5:21-CV-5069</a> (W.D. Ark. Jul. 24, 2023) (entering judgment on jury verdict). </cite>
</p>

<p>
What seems to have sunk Walmart's case was that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The parties' email exchanges, with specifics about the quantity and pricing, appear to have clearly met the UCC requirements for enforceability, despite Walmart's seemingly "strained" arguments to the contrary.</li>

<li>There was no dispute that the Walmart buyer who'd dealt with K7 (including those email exchanges) had the authority to place orders.</li>

<li>The Supply Agreement didn't specify any particular form that an "Order" had to take to be binding.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Apparently Walmart wasn't the only retailer that refused to take delivery or pay for hand sanitizer that it ordered during the pandemic: K7 also sued <a href="https://grocery-insightmagazine.com/kroger-sued-for-85-million-by-k7-design-group/">the Kroger grocery chain</a> and, separately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Below">Five Below, Inc.</a>, a Philadelphia-based chain of speciality discount stores, alleging much the same thing as in its Walmart case. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14478678536160230084">K7 Design Grp., Inc. v. Five Below, Inc.</a>, 540 F. Supp. 3d 508 (E.D. Pa. 2021) (denying Five Below's motion to dismiss). </cite>
</p>

<p>
After a five-day trial, a jury found for Five Below on all counts. <cite> <i>See id.</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16124042259660951285">No. 21-1406</a> (E.D. Pa. Jun. 21, 2023) (awarding costs to Five Below). </cite>
</p>



<p>
EXAMPLE: During the economic downturn accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic, the prominent retail chain Paper Source:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>loaded up on inventory from its small-business suppliers, ordering unusually-large quantities of merchandise — as reported by the Washington Post, "Paper Source ordered more from The Card Bureau in a 60-day period than it had in all of 2020"; and</li>

<li>then, in effect, tore up the bills by filing for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp">bankruptcy</a> protection — the legal effect of which was to allow Paper Source (mostly) to stiff its suppliers, likely paying them something like pennies on the dollar. <cite> See Jeremy Hill, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/paper-source-bankruptcy-squeezes-small-greeting-card-sellers/2021/03/05/7d17a80c-7dfb-11eb-8c5e-32e47b42b51b_story.html">Paper Source Bankruptcy Squeezes Small Greeting Card Sellers</a> (WashingtonPost.com March 5, 2021).

</ul>

<p>
Later, Paper Source was purchased by the owner of the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain, an activist investment management fund, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management">Elliott Investment Management</a>. <cite> See Nadine El-Bawab, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/barnes-noble-owner-buys-stationery-retailer-paper-source-out-of-bankruptcy.html">Barnes & Noble owner buys stationery retailer Paper Source out of bankruptcy</a> (CNBC.com May 11, 2021). </cite>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A target company's assets were acquired by a newly-created <i>subsidiary</i> of the party that the target company had anticipated would be the buyer.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That newly-created subsidiary turned out to be judgment-proof, so the target company didn't get all the payments it bargained for.</li>

<li>Worse: The acquisition agreement evidently didn't provide any kind of backup payment source (see <a href="#r-pmt-sec-addl">9.2</a>), such as a guaranty (see <a href="#r-guar-proto">9.5</a>) of the subsidiary's payment obligations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, the target company lost. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7341524000586289043">Northbound Group, Inc. v. Norvax, Inc.</a>, 795 F.3d 647, 650 (7th Cir. 2015) (cleaned up), <i>affirming</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11445428986521429895">5 F. Supp. 3d 956, 972-74</a> (N.D. Ill. 2013). </cite>
</p>

<h5 id="pmt-sec-bkgd-constr"><span class="section-number-5">9.2.11.2.</span> One common use: Avoiding subcontractor liens in construction projects</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-pmt-sec-bkgd-constr">
<p>
Here's a common use for backup-payment arrangements:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A landowner enters into a "prime contract" with a general contractor (or "prime") to get a building built.</li>

<li>The prime contract contemplates that the general contractor will hire, coordinate, <i>and pay</i>, various specialist subcontractors ("subs") to do various specific things such as demolish the existing building ("demo work"); pour a foundation for the new building; erect the building's frame and roof; install electrical wiring; install plumbing; and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>
[DCT TO DO: Diagram showing payments by customer to contractor to subcontractor?]
</p>

<p>
The general contractor's obligation to pay its subs is important to the owner:  If the general contractor were to fail to pay a sub, the law would likely allow the sub:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to demand payment from the owner — which likely has already paid the general contractor — and/or</li>

<li>to place a lien on the owner's property, thus placing a "cloud" on the owner's title and complicating the owner's life. <cite> See generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanic%27s_lien">Mechanic's lien</a> (Wikipedia.org); <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mechanics-lien.asp">Mechanic's Lien Definition</a> (Investopedia.com). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
For that reason, in negotiating the prime contract with the general contractor, the owner might well require the general contractor to obtain "payment security" to make sure that the subs got paid.
</p>

<p>
(The prime contract likely would also require the owner to obtain financing from a bank or other lender, so that the general contractor would have assurance that <i>it</i> would be paid.)

<div id="outline-container-bkup-pmt-forms-c" class="outline-5 olnum">
<h5 id="bkup-pmt-forms-c"><span class="section-number-5">9.2.11.3.</span> What form(s) of backup payment might be used?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-bkup-pmt-forms-c">
<p>
Here are a few possible backup sources of funding:
</p>

<p>
1.   A supplier could ask for a <b>deposit —</b> possibly into "escrow," to be held by a third party until stated conditions are met. See Protocol <a href="#r-pmt-depos">9.3</a> (deposits) and its commentary; see also <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp">Escrow</a> (Investopedia.com).
</p>

<p>
2.   A supplier could ask its customer to provide a <b>standby letter of credit</b> ("SLOC"): In return for a fee, <i>a bank</i> agrees to pay the amount due if the customer doesn't do so. (In effect, a SLOC is a prearranged line of credit <i>for Biller</i> with <i>Payer's</i> bank, with Payer being responsible for repaying the bank; see generally <a href="#nl-ltr-crdt-cmt">10.7</a> for a court's explanation of how SLOCs work.)
</p>

<p>
3.   A supplier could ask its customer for a <b>guaranty</b> from a third party — concerning which, see Protocol <a href="#r-guar-proto">9.5</a>.
</p>

<p>
4.  <a id="org360632b"></a> The supplier could ask to take a <b>security interest</b> in real estate or other property (tangible or intangible), referred to as "collateral" — but that could be burdensome for all concerned, as discussed at  Protocol <a href="#nl-sec-int-top">10.10</a>.
</p>

<p>
5.  <a id="org000205a"></a> A customer hiring a contractor could ask the contractor to buy a <b>payment bond</b> from an insurance carrier, typically referred to as a "<b>surety</b>." Then, if the contractor fails to pay its subcontractors, then the surety is responsible for paying any unpaid suppliers and subcontractors. <cite> See generally <a href="https://www.irmi.com/term/insurance-definitions/payment-bond">Payment bond</a> (IRMI.com). </cite>
</p>

<p>
In fact, a customer deaing with a prime contractor will often negotiate to <i>require</i> the prime contractor to obtain a payment bond. The intent is to keep the prime contractor's unpaid <i>subcontractors</i> and suppliers from filing a mechanic's lien or materialman's lien (nowadays often referred to as a "supplier's lien") on the customer's project. <cite> See generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanic%27s_lien">Mechanic's lien</a> (Wikipedia.org). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Indeed: Under the federal Miller Act, a prime contractor working on a government project must furnish a bond; if the prime contractor fails to pay subcontractors, laborers, and/or suppliers for "labor" or "materials," then those payees can sue the bond provider (typically an insurance carrier). <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16183679734173729652">United States ex rel. Dickson v. Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Md.</a>, 67 F.4th 182, 184 (Fed. Cir. 2023): The court affirmed a trial court's judgment that a project manager's work within the statutory limitation period was not "labor" and therefore could not be collected from a surety. </cite>
</p>

<p>
But: "A key difference between suretyship and insurance is that sureties do not expect to bear the risk of loss." That is, a surety that must pay out will usually try to recoup its payment(s) from its insured, that is, from the nonpaying contractor. <cite> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/minnesota/supreme-court/2025/a23-1478.html">United Prairie Bank v. Molnau Trucking LLC</a>, No. A23-1478, slip op. at 9 n.5 (Minn. Jul. 16, 2025) (reversing and remanding affirmance of summary judgment). <b>Note to students:</b> This Minnesota opinion contains a useful primer on the basics of surety law, with citations. <i>See id.</i>, slip op. at 8-10. </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Here's a scenario</b> involving the interplay between sureties and security interests (see <a href="#org360632b">item 4</a> above: Suppose that the surety on a payment bond has to pay a defaulting contractor's suppliers, etc. — but the contractor's assets are subject to a perfected security interest held by a lender, which itself is being stiffed by the contractor. <b>Question:</b> Who gets priority: the surety, or the unpaid lender? Minnesota's supreme court says it's the surety: "[T]hrough the doctrine of equitable subrogation, a performing surety has priority over a secured creditor as to contract funds created by the surety’s performance on its bond obligations." <cite> <i>Id.</i>, slip op. at 2; <i>see also id.</i> at part II, slip op. at 14-21 (detailed analysis and citations). </cite>
</p>

<p>
6.   <a id="org07171e2"></a> A customer hiring a contractor could ask the contractor to buy a <b>performance bond</b>, a.k.a. a contract bond, to have a backup pot of money available:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to fund a party's performance of its contractual obligations;</li>

<li>to guarantee availability of materials needed for the work (this is known as a <b>supply bond</b>); and/or</li>

<li>to hire a replacement contractor to finish work that the original contractor either failed to do or failed to do correctly. <cite> See generally, e.g., <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/performancebond.asp">Performance bond</a> (Investopedia.com); James Clark and Daniel Miktus, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/comply-or-else-additional-obligees-must-4008993">Comply or Else: Additional Obligees Must Comply with Conditions Precedent in Performance Bonds</a> (JDSupra.com 2023); Christopher Herron, Steve Todd, and Kenny Young, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/exposure-analysis-the-performance-bond-2753990">Exposure Analysis: The Performance Bond Cost to Complete</a> (JDSupra.com 2022); <a href="https://www.nfp.com/property-and-casualty/coverage-expertise/commercial-and-contract-surety/surety/bonds-types/supply-bond/">Supply Bond</a> (NFP.com, undated). </cite></li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-pmt-sec-depos">
<p>
One easy alternative to engaging a Bank would be for the Payer to provide the Biller with a deposit (concerning which, see Protocol <a href="#r-pmt-depos">9.3</a>).
</p>
</div>

<h5 id="pmt-bkup-bkrpt-c"><span class="section-number-5">9.2.11.5.</span> Payer bankruptcy is a big reason for backup arrangements.</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-pmt-bkup-bkrpt-c">
<p>
Bankruptcy law is a major reason that the Biller might want the Payer to keep backup-payment arrangements in place: Without such arrangements, if the Payer were to file for bankruptcy protection, then under U.S. law:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the Biller might end up recovering no more than pennies on the dollar in the bankruptcy proceedings; and</li>

<li>the Biller might be forced to <i>refund</i>, as a "preference" (see <a href="#nl-GuarPrefPmtRef">28.3.3</a>), some or all of any payment made by the Payer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Consequently, the Biller would very much like to be able to demand payment from a backup payment source such as a bank, whose financial resources would thus serve as an alternative "pot of money" from which the Biller could reimbursement of any preference refund.
</p>

<p>
(For more on personal guaranties of commercial leases in the bankruptcy context, see generally <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/landlord-considerations-when-navigating-1404426/">Gordon, Spero, and Vath</a> (2024).)

<h5 id="pmt-bkup-cost-c"><span class="section-number-5">9.2.11.6.</span> Backup payment arrangements aren't free of charge</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-pmt-bkup-cost-c">
<p>
A.&nbsp; When a bank or other financial institution agrees to serve as a backup payer, it's highly unlikely to do so for free, unless the arrangement is folded into some other credit arrangement that Payer already has with the bank — and if the <i>Payer</i> must pay for a backup-payment arrangement (as in Option A), then the Payer will likely consider that expense in determining, for example, whether to accept a particular supplier's bid for an order or project.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if the Biller, e.g., a supplier, must pay for a backup-payment arrangement (as in Opion B), then that expense will factor into Biller's pricing position.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; In Option A, subdivision 2 is intended as a guardrail, to block an unscrupulous Payer from rolling the dice and asking the Biller for reimbursement anyway, on a theory of, <i>let's give it a shot, the worst that can happen is they say "no."</i> That's not the behavior of a reliable business partner (and it also creates what's known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard">"moral hazard"</a>).
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Here's a tangential point to consider: When the Bank prices its fee for serving as a backup payer (a.k.a. a "surety"), the Bank will consider its own potential risk exposure: "[I]nsurers cannot seek reimbursement from their insureds for amounts paid out under the policy, whereas sureties can require reimbursement from the obligor (contractor) for any losses incurred by the surety under the bond." <cite> Colm Nelson, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ways-to-guard-against-insolvency-risks-1703578">Ways to Guard Against Insolvency Risks</a> (JDSupra.com 2022). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-r-pmt-depos">
<p>
Deposits are commonplace in business.

</p>

<p>
Note: This Protocol sets out only basic steps for handling deposits that are provided. It's up to the parties and their drafters to negotiate <b>and document</b>, for example, what if any deposits would be needed; in what amounts; and when made.

A.&nbsp; This section doesn't merely say that the Payer <i>doesn't have to pay</i> ineligible reimbursement claims.

B.&nbsp; Moreover, a mere <i>declaration</i> that ineligible reimbursement claims need not be paid wouldn't necessarily be treated as a contractual <i>commitment</i> not to seek ineligible reimbursements, so that doing so anyway would be a breach of the contract.

<p>
Advance agreement about "borderline" expenses can help to avoid later disputes.
</p>

<p>
<b>But:</b> Drafters for Billers should watch out for mandatory language such as that in a clause I once reviewed, in a customer's purchase-order fine print:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The clause in question <i>required</i> any supplier seeking reimbursement to "flag" any even-arguably borderline expenses. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;   Presumably, that requirement was to help avoid unpleasant surprises in reimbursement requests.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  But a party <i>incurring</i> expenses probably wouldn't want to agree to a <i>mandatory</i> expense-flagging requirement — because a stingy reimbursing party could try to use a supposed flagging failure as an excuse to withhold reimbursement.
</p>

<p>
If a Payer wanted to insist on preapproval rights, it could ask for language such as the following:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="orga3084c7">
<p>
Payer may opt not to reimburse Biller for any expense, not preapproved by Payer, in the following categories: [FILL IN].
</p>

</div>

<p>
Note that under the above language, a Biller would not be breaching the Con&shy;tract if it didn't get preapproval: Instead, the Biller simply might not get paid — which likely would be plenty of motivation for the Biller to get preapproval.

<p>
Suppose that a Biller submits a request for reimbursement that doesn't comply with this Protocol, <i>and Payer's accounts-payable people process the request and pay the reimbursement</i>. In that situation, Payer should be able to recover the payment, or to take an "<a href="#pmt-off">offset</a>" against the next payment due, without having Biller object that Payer supposedly waived the noncompliance. 
</p>

<p>
A Payer drafter could use language along the following lines to be explicit about this:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org1f5c5e8">
<p>
For the avoidance of doubt: If Payer reimburses an expense whose submission did not comply with a requirement of the Con&shy;tract, then Payer's action is not a waiver by Payer of that contractual requirement unless the circumstances unmistakably indicate otherwise.

<p>
When a party expects to be paid by another party under a contract, sometimes it might not clear that the other party will be good for the money. In that situation, the prospective payee might want to consider asking for a guaranty from a third party that <i>is</i> likely to be able to pay up. EXAMPLE: A famous example: Tech billionaire Larry Ellison <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/22/larry-ellison-40-billion-paramount-warner-bros">offered to personally guarantee</a> $40 billion of the $108 billion offered by Paramount Skydance — controlled by Ellison and his son David — for control of Warner Brothers Discovery.

This Protocol offers a streamlined, boiled-down version of some of the most important features (at least in my view) of many "in the wild" guaranties.

No: The Guaranty is unconditional and is a guaranty of <i>payment</i>, not of <i>collection</i> — so the Guarantor will pay the Creditor as stated in this Protocol, whether or not the Creditor tried (successfully or otherwise) to collect the past-due payment from the Debtor — whether by filing a lawsuit or otherwise.

<p>
A.&nbsp; An "unconditional guaranty" is a guaranty of <i>payment</i>, not of (eventual) <i>collection</i> of the Debt. As the Seventh Circuit explained: "Unlike a <i>conditional</i> guaranty, an <i>unconditional</i> guaranty does not require a creditor to attempt collection from the principal debtor before looking to the guarantor." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4017802821161967869">Hovde v.

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b> <b>In Texas, by statute</b>, even a guarantor of <i>payment</i> (as opposed to of collection) would have the right to demand that the creditor — "without delay" — file a lawsuit against the debtor, absent which the guarantor is not liable for the guaranteed payment obligation. <cite> See <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CP/htm/CP.43.htm">Tex.

Bankruptcy law is a major reason that the Creditor might want the Guarantor to guarantee the Debt: Without a guaranty, if the Debtor were to file for bankruptcy protection, then the Creditor might end up recovering no more than pennies on the dollar in the bankruptcy proceedings — moreover, as discussed at <a href="#nl-GuarPrefPmtRef">28.3.3</a>, under U.S. bankruptcy law the Creditor might be forced to refund as a "preference" some or all of any payment made by the Debtor. </aside>

<p>
A.&nbsp; Generally speaking, a "subordination agreement," between the Debtor and a third party (such as a lender other than the Creditor), is an agreement that requires the Debtor to fulfill particular prerequisites — such as by paying what the Debtor owes to the third party — <span class="underline">before</span> the Debtor pays some or all of the Debt.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; EXAMPLE: In a Seventh Circuit decision about a guaranteed debt: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The debtor had entered into a subordination agreement that prohibited the <i>debtor</i> from making certain payments until specified conditions were met.</li>

<li>Those conditions hadn't been met — so the debtor hadn't paid the creditor of the guaranteed debt.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court held that, due to the debtor's subordination agreement, the <i>guarantor</i> wasn't yet liable either on the guaranteed debt. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15960085416786274945">Indigo Old Corp., Inc. v.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: When a contract has multiple Guar&shy;an&shy;tors, the Creditor will likely want to be able to proceed against any and all of multiple Guar&shy;an&shy;tors, as is convenient for the Creditor (and perhaps the Creditor's lawyers), for the full amount of the unpaid debt; see generally <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/joint_and_several_liability">joint and several liability</a> (law.cornell.edu).
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> If you're one of multiple Guar&shy;an&shy;tors and will be guaranteeing <i>multiple</i> Debts, it's a really good idea for you to be clear about the extent to <i>which</i> Guar&shy;an&shy;tors are liable for which obligations. DCT note: When my daughter was in college, she rented one bedroom in a four-bedroom, off-campus apartment with three friends. The landlord, of course, wanted the students' parents to guarantee payment of the rent. BUT: Each parent guaranteed payment only for that parent's child, not for any of the other students' bedrooms.

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 3's This "right of contribution" means that if one of several Guar&shy;an&shy;tors makes a payment under the Guaranty, then the paying Guar&shy;an&shy;tor is entitled to be reimbursed by all other Guar&shy;an&shy;tors for their pro-rata shares of the payment (generally, equal shares if not otherwise agreed). <cite> See generally <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/contribution">contribution</a> (law.cornell.edu). </cite>

Professor Stephen Sepinuck, a noted authority on commercial law, suggests that a guarantor might want either: &bull; to cap the <i>amount</i> of the guarantor’s liability, or &bull; to cover only a specified <i>portion</i> or <i>percentage</i> of the debt. He adds: "From the creditor’s perspective, the former is clearly preferable and the latter should be avoided at all costs" because costly disputes could arise about how particular payments are to be allocated between the guaranteed portion and the non-guaranteed portion. <cite> See Stephen L. Sepinuck, <a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu/-/media/Website/Documents/Academics/School-of-Law/Clinic-and-Centers/Commercial-Law-Center/Links-and-Resources/Transactional-Lawyer-2017-10.ashx">Suggestions for Drafting Guaranties</a>, The Transactional Lawyer, Oct. 2017, at 1, 2 (Gonzaga.edu), archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/QVY7-YNPH">https://perma.cc/QVY7-YNPH</a>. </cite>

A.&nbsp; This simply restates the general rule — which typically is strictly applied by courts — that "a guarantor is discharged if, <i>without his or her consent</i>, the contract of guaranty is materially altered." <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13471608492566654300">Eagerton v.

B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Some creditors' guaranty documents "write around" this general rule by stating otherwise — <b>but:</b> Just imagine how that could create problems for the Guarantor, perhaps leaving the Guarantor on the hook for far more than the Guarantor signed up for.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>any assertion that the Guarantor's obligations under the Guaranty are allegedly illegal, invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable — this includes, without limitation, any defense of: waiver or release of the (unpaid) Debt; statute of limitations; res judicata; statute of frauds; fraud; incapacity; minority; usury; illegality; invalidity; voidness; or other unenforceability; where the claim or defense might otherwise be available to Debtor or to any other individual or organization that might be liable in respect of the Debt;</li>

<p>
A.&nbsp; Banks and other creditors often want guarantors to waive <span class="underline">any</span> defense to the debt — so that a bank could sue a guarantor to collect a debt even if the bank would be unable to enforce the debt against the debtor.
</p>

<p>
An "absolute" guaranty would likely waive the Guarantor's defenses to the Debt — that's why some drafters for <i>creditors</i> like for want guaranty language to start out, "[GuarantorName] <i>absolutely and</i> unconditionally guarantees &#x2026;."  The word <i>absolutely</i> could preclude the guarantor from contesting the validity of the underlying payment obligation (see § <a href="#guar-def">9.5.15</a>).
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A bankrupt company's CEO got nowhere in arguing that he shouldn't be liable on his personal guaranty of nearly $42 million that the company owed to a bank. The CEO asserted that the debt had been fraudulently incurred, without the CEO-guarantor's knowledge, by the since-deceased <i>president</i> of the company (a different individual). New York's highest court rejected the CEO's argument, holding that his allegations did not overcome the waiver of defenses and "absolute and unconditional" liability provision in the guaranty. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11081049436389993245">Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank, B.A. v. Navarro</a>, 25 N.Y.3d 485, 36 N.E.3d 80, 15 N.Y.S.3d 277 (2015) (affirming reversal of summary judgment in favor of guarantors). </cite>
</p>

<p>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: The federal bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York held that liquidated-damages provisions in aircraft leases were unenforceable penalties and thus — as a matter of public policy — could not be enforced against the leases' guarantors any more than they could be enforced against the original debtors. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=781843091277722119">Moayedi v. Interstate 35/Chisam Road, LP</a>, 438 S.W.3d 1, 3 (Tex. 2014). </cite>
</p>

<p>
In what <i>could</i> be a counterexample, the Seventh Circuit affirmed summary judgment that a guarantor's waiver of defenses did not waive the guarantor's right to assert <i>the statute of limitations</i> as a defense, because the statute affected only the <i>legal enforceability</i> of the guaranty without negating the underlying obligation. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4017802821161967869">Hovde v. ISLA Develpment LLC</a>, 51 F.4th 771, 777 (7th Cir. 2022) (affirming dismissal of creditors' claim against guarantor on statute-of-limitations grounds). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; True: in some circumstances, it might seem unfair to make the guarantor pay an unpaid debt. But if the guarantor waives defenses to the debt, a court will often give effect to that waiver and enforce payment anyway.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; California provides statutory language that can be used for waivers of defenses to a debt; see <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=2856.&lawCode=CIV">Cal. Civ. Code § 2856</a>.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Source note: Some of the defenses waived above are based on language of the respective guaranties in two cases from the highest courts of New York and Alabama, respectively. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11081049436389993245">Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank, B.A. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-5-17-1">
<p>
In at least some jurisdictions, courts interpret guaranties strictly against the creditor — often relying on the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule on the premise that the creditor drafted the guaranty language. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/2025/a-28-24.html">Extech Building Materials, Inc. v. E&N Construction, Inc.</a>, No. A-28-24, slip op. at 10, 12 (N.J. Dec. 2, 2025). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-5-17-2">
<p>
In drafting a contract that includes a guaranty obligation, the safest approach might be to include a separate signature line for the guaranty: A given jurisdiction might not have a bright-line requirement on that score, but it's still best to leave no room for doubt that a signer is undertaking the obligations of a guarantor. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/2025/a-28-24.html">Extech Building Materials, Inc. v. E&N Construction, Inc.</a>, No. A-28-24, slip op. at 15, 17 (N.J.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-5-17-3">
<p>
A purported guaranty document should make it clear to a signer that the signer is undertaking the obligations of a guarantor. That didn't happen in <i>Extech</i> (N.J. 2025): A construction company's president signed a supplier's credit application that had one signature line. The signature line included the pre-printed phrase "(No Title)." New Jersey's supreme court held that this didn't make it clear to signers that they were personally guaranteeing payment to the supplier. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/2025/a-28-24.html">Extech Building Materials, Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-5-17-4">
<p>
A guaranty should be clear about just <i>whose</i> obligations are being guaranteed, because a creditor's aggressive position on this issue — possibly for an unrelated debt — could lead to litigation. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9238135018609682729">McLane Foodservice, Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-guar-bur">
<p>
A standard-form contract might include guaranty language that the parties might not have specifically discussed but that could be enforceable against an individual who signs on behalf of a corporation or LLC. EXAMPLE: This happened in a Florida case where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A corporation, 688 Skate Park, was the tenant in a lease.</li>

<li>The signature block correctly listed 688 Skate Park as the party agreeing to the lease.</li>

<li>The lease was signed on behalf of 688 Skate Park by one Jay Turner "as its President."</li>

<li>Unfortunately for Mr. Turner, though, the lease form also included a statement that "the individual executing this Lease on behalf of said corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership, guarantees the obligations of Tenant hereunder."</li>
</ul>

<p>
The result: A Florida appellate court held that Mr. Turner could be personally liable on the lease. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7415164309022923452">Coleman v. 688 Skate Park, Inc.</a>, 40 So.3d 867 (Fla. App. 2010) (reversing district court's dismissal of landlord's suit against guarantor; emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Similarly, in a Mississippi supreme court case, a company president signed a commercial lease in his representative capacity — but the lease also contained language stating that the company personally and unconditionally guaranteed the company's financial obligations. This, said the supreme court (citing cases), had the effect of binding the company president to the lease's arbitration clause. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7493219288753625545">R.K.

<h6 id="org13e0d46">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org13e0d46">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Many (perhaps most) jurisdictions have enacted legislation setting maximum permissible interest rates, and also whether simple- or compound interest is permitted. Drafters of interest provisions should be sure to check applicable law for the maximum interest rate. 
</p>

<p>
(The maximum rate might depend on whether the parties have <i>agreed</i> to a particular rate.)
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The gap-filler interest rate of this Protocol (i.e., a rate charged in the absence of agreement) and the "simple interest" term (i.e., not compound interest) are written with the usury laws in Texas and New York in mind. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/BNK/14-A">N.Y. Banking Law § 14-a</a> (16%); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1963007270710822546">1077 Madison Street, LLC v. Daniels</a>, 954 F.3d 460 (2d Cir. 2020) (affirming summary judgment rejecting usury defense); <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FI/htm/FI.302.htm#302">Tex. Fin.

</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; The Texas supreme court has noted that: "The default rule in Texas accords with <b>the general rule</b>: absent clear and specific contractual or statutory authorization, <b>compound interest is prohibited, and only simple interest is available</b>." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5884357313867497756">Samson Exploration, LLC v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-int-chg-worth">
<p>
To speed up negotiation, a drafter representing a Biller might not want to bother including an interest provision in the Con&shy;tract, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Even without a contract provision</b>, the law might allow the charging of interest on past-due amounts. For example, <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FI/htm/FI.302.htm">section 302.002</a> of the Texas Finance Code states in part: "If a creditor has not agreed with an obligor to charge the obligor any interest, the creditor may charge and receive from the obligor legal interest at the rate of six percent a year on the principal amount of the credit extended beginning on the 30th day after the date on which the amount is due. &#x2026;"</li>

<li>Some customers have been known to announce, imperiously: <i>We don't pay interest, period, and if you want our business, that's the way it is</i>. And so <b>even bringing up the subject</b> of interest might "poke the bear" (see <a href="#poke-bear">30.14</a>), i.e., cause the Payer to insist that the Con&shy;tract instead <i>prohibit</i> the Biller from charging interest — and <b>such a prohibition would likely override</b> the law's allowance of interest charges.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So: For a Biller, this could be one of those times when <b>silence</b> (about interest charges) <b>might be the better choice</b> during negotiation of the Con&shy;tract.

A.&nbsp; Such invoicing prerequisites could include, without limitation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a schedule, based (for example) on calendar time and/or achievement of milestones; and/or</li>

<li>deadlines, either as specified dates or tied to other events.</li>
</ul>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The timing of invoice issuance can affect the parties' respective cash flows. For example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's not uncommon for suppliers to send invoices only after they finish their performance under the Con&shy;tract, for example, upon delivery of ordered goods or completion of services performance — and it's also <i>very</i> typical for customers to prefer (even insist) on this.</li>

<li>BUT: In construction- and other services agreements, the service provider will often want to get some money up front — to pay for materials, ensure that it will be paid <i>something</i> even if the customer stiff the provider etc..</li>

<li>A service provider will also want to be paid as soon as possible <i>after particular phases of the contracted work are completed</i> — as opposed to waiting to be paid until all phases of the work is 100% complete.</li>
</ul>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Some contracts will state when <i>interim</i> invoices are to be sent, e.g.:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>every month (as is typically the case with law firms' invoices) or every fiscal quarter, and/or</li>

<li>when specified performance targets are reached, e.g., when a concrete foundation has been poured for a building under construction.</li>

<p>
A.&nbsp; If you're a Payer, you might well have a legitimate reason for imposing a deadline for invoice submission. For example, you could be concerned about having to "restate" financial results* for the relevant fiscal period, because such a restatement could be necessary if a late invoice were to materially alter the customer's already-reported results. <cite> See generally Investopedia, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restatement.asp">Restatement</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Note: For a public company, any restatement of reported financial results is a Bad Thing: It'd likely cause a sharp drop in the company's stock price, resulting from diminished investor confidence in the company's accounting practices. EXAMPLE: This happened to one company, Calgon Carbon, reportedly because the company's general counsel didn't timely forward outside law-firm invoices to the company's accounting department — evidently causing the general counsel to lose his job.<sup><a id="fnr.InvCalgon" class="footref" href="#fn.InvCalgon" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup>

B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> In some jurisdictions, a court might regard such a waiver provision as being a forfeiture — and as the Texas supreme court explained, generally under U.S. law, "[f]orfeitures are not favored &#x2026; contracts are construed to avoid them." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14346968413029904775">Fischer v.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orga169712">
<p>
A.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> It's probably not a good idea to lock down the invoicing method in the Con&shy;tract: That would mean that a change to that procedure could require an amendment to the Con&shy;tract. That'd likely be a pain. 
</p>

<p>
Sure, as a practical matter, if a Payer paid an "improperly" submitted invoice, that'd likely be a <a href="#r-waiv-defn">waiver</a> of the submission requirement in the Con&shy;tract. But why set that up as a potential dispute?
</p>

<p>
And keep in mind that incentives matter, too: In a B2B context, the Biller will usually be motivated to go along with any (reasonable) request that the Payer makes about invoice submission request — because the Biller will (probably) care more about getting paid quickly than about insisting on using any particular method for submitting invoices.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip</b> for Biller billing departments: Suppose that your contract with a big-fish Payer is silent about invoicing method. It might still be worth your time to check whether the Payer <i>prefers</i> any particular method of invoicing. For example, the Payer might use a particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_invoicing">electronic invoicing</a> system and might prefer that its suppliers submit invoices that way. 
</p>

<p>
Checking with the Payer in this way could help speed up your getting paid — thus improving your company's accounting metric known as "<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dso.asp">DSOs</a>," i.e., days sales outstanding.

A.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> The Biller will want to <b>consider <span class="underline">not</span> including, in the invoice, the Biller's bank-account information</b>, especially if the invoice might be seen by others (e.g., by email, which could be forwarded and/or hacked). It's often better to provide bank-account information by phone or other, more-secure channel.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution — Payer:</b> You'll want to act promptly if an invoice doesn't contain enough "substantive details" to allow for appropriate review. That's because a court might not be sympathetic if your contract didn't require such detail. EXAMPLE: A Delaware trial court held that one payer had waited too long to object to an invoice's itemization — seemingly with an ulterior motive, according to the court — and so had lost its right to contest the invoice:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
Nor is the Court persuaded that Trimble's obligation to timely dispute the invoices was nullified by the invoices' lack of substantive details. The Court accepts that Trimble may have been disadvantaged by being contractually required to dispute invoices with forty-five days when the invoices didn't provide many specifics to dispute.
</p>

<p>
But litigation is not an arena in which to bargain for new terms. Trimble's concern would have been better raised when the [contract] was negotiated in early 2020. Barring that, Trimble could have brought it up in response to any one of the dozens of invoices that Trimble approved and paid. Trimble didn't do so. Instead, Trimble waited until it had reason to evade Section 5.1 to bemoan this supposed inequity. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1518981939899646727">Outbox Sys., Inc. v.

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
13.  Invoicing and Payment 
</p>

<p>
After each shipment made or service provided, Supplier will submit an invoice listing a description of the Goods provided and, as applicable, part numbers, quantity, unit of measure, hours, and the unit and total prices. 
</p>

<p>
This invoice must match the corresponding Purchase Order pricing, quantities, and terms, 
</p>

<p>
and must be sent to the invoice address listed on the Purchase Order. 
</p>

<p>
All applicable taxes and other Government charges including, but not limited to, sales, use, or excise taxes; value added tax, customs duties, fees and all incidental charges including but not limited to royalties, selling commissions, nonrecurring engineering, or other incidental charges must be separately itemized and identified on the invoice.
</p>

<p>
The invoice must also include the following information in English, or in the destination country’s official language if required: 
</p>

<p>
(a) name and address of Supplier and the Honeywell entity purchasing the Goods; 
</p>

<p>
(b) name of shipper (if different from Supplier); 
</p>

<p>
(c) Honeywell’s Purchase Order number(s); 
</p>

<p>
(d) country of export; 
</p>

<p>
(e) detailed description of the Goods; 
</p>

<p>
(f) Harmonized Tariff Schedule number; 
</p>

<p>
(g) country of origin (manufacture) of the Goods, or if multiple countries of origin, the country of origin of each part shipped; 
</p>

<p>
(h) weights of the Goods shipped; 
</p>

<p>
(i) currency in which the sale was made; 
</p>

<p>
(j) payment terms; 
</p>

<p>
(k) shipment terms used; and 
</p>

<p>
(l) all rebates or discounts. 
</p>

<p>
The invoice will be accompanied (if applicable) by a signed bill of lading or express receipt evidencing shipment. 
</p>

<p>
Payment of an invoice does not constitute acceptance of the Goods 
</p>

<p>
and is subject to appropriate adjustment should Supplier fail to meet the requirements of the Purchase Order. 
</p>

<p>
Payment terms are net 120 days from receipt of a Honeywell-approved invoice unless otherwise stated on the face of the Purchase Order or other written agreement executed by both parties. 
</p>

<p>
Invoices will not be approved unless they accurately reference conforming Goods received by Honeywell or services satisfactorily performed for Honeywell. 
</p>

<p>
Payment will be scheduled for the first payment cycle following the net terms for the Purchase Order.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-pmt-terms-appl">
<p>
This Protocol will apply whenever, under the Con&shy;tract, one party clearly identified in the Con&shy;tract (a "<b>Biller</b>") is owed money by another party (a "<b>Payer</b>").
</p>

<p>
The Payer need not pay the Biller under the Con&shy;tract if the Biller doesn't invoice the Payer for the amount due as set out at Protocol <a href="#r-invoice-top">9.7</a>.  
</p>

<h6 id="org836f046">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org836f046">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Invoices typically <i>aren't</i> required in "strategic" transactions such as real-estate sales and mergers and acquisitions — instead, the other party simply won't go ahead with the deal (e.g., sign the real-estate deed or the merger closing documents) until the agreed payment is received. 
</p>

<p>
(In such transactions, sometimes an agreed payment will be received by an escrow agent (see <a href="#nl-escrow-nts">28.10</a>) and then later passed on to the payee.)
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Other types of contract — for example, IP license agreements — might require the Payer to pay without an invoice or other demand for payment.
</p>

<p>
<b>But:</b> Invoices are increasingly required even in contracts such as intellectual-property license agreements:  The payer would be the licensee of the IP in question, and for example submits a report of its licensed sales to the IP owner or other licensor — possibly with a proposed computation of royalties (or other amounts) due; the IP owner then sends an invoice to the licensee.
</p>

<p>
And if a contract does require an invoice, then the payer wouldn't breach the contract if it didn't pay without first getting an invoice. EXAMPLE: This happened in a Texas oil-patch case, where a joint operating agreement included a modified version of an industry-standard accounting procedure, which stated that payment was required within 30 days after receiving an invoice. The plaintiff hadn't invoiced the defendant, so the appeals court reversed a trial-court judgment for approximately $2 million in favor of the plaintiff and rendered a take-nothing judgment in favor of the defendant. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3372219188915250217">CL III Funding Holding Company, LLC v. Steelhead Midstream Partners, LLC</a>, No. 02-21-00188-CV, slip op. (Tex. App&#x2013;Fort Worth Jan. 8, 2026), <i>on remand from</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10238251956820507969">709 S.W.3d 605</a>, 605-08 (Tex. 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; In an <i>employment</i> contract, it'd be nonsensical to require the employee to provide the employer with an invoice for each paycheck. (It'd be a different story for a true consulting-agreement relationship, of course.)
</p>

<p>
For that matter: In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act might well make it illegal for an employer even to require an employee to turn in a timesheet as a prerequisite to getting paid. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/hr-qa/pages/holdingpaychecks.aspx">Can we hold an employee’s paycheck because he or she didn’t turn in a timesheet?</a> (SHRM.org, undated). </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Language choice</b> — "the Payer need not pay": To reduce the potential for disputes, this section is intentionally phrased so that the Biller's failure to submit an invoice as required by the Con&shy;tract is not a breach of the Con&shy;tract — it merely means that the Payer needn't pay the invoice.

<h6 id="orgdebe553">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgdebe553">
<p>
A.&nbsp; When a contract says payment is due "net 30 days," it means that payment is due <i>in full</i> in 30 days.  
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The contract might also say, for example: "Payments: <i>2% 10 days, net 30 days</i>"; this means that: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the paying party may deduct 2% as a discount for payment in full within 10 days, but</li>
<li>payment in full is due in any case within 30 days.</li>
</ul>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Here are a few net-X-days examples:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Net 30 days is pretty standard for payment for goods.</li>

<li>Net 45 days and even net 60 days are generally considered to be within the band of reasonableness (more or less).</li>

<li>Contractors and other service providers often ask for net 10 or net 15 day terms, or even "due on receipt" (not uncommon for law-firm invoices to clients).</li>

<li>Some customers demand net 75, net 90, and even net 120 days — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/7ia7dg/ge_has_forced_all_future_purchase_orders_to_120/">GE reportedly did this</a> at one point — essentially using their suppliers as grudging sources of interest-free working capital.</li>
</ul>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Payment terms are often negotiated, because as a general rule:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Biller would like to be paid as soon as possible — the Biller has (presumably) earned the money, so it wants to be able to use that money for its business purposes; but</li>

<li>The Payer, on the other hand, would prefer to hold onto <i>its</i> money for as long as possible, because that allows the Payer, in effect, to use (what rightfully is) the <i>Biller's</i> cash to finance Payer's operations — it's as though the Biller was making an interest-free loan to the Payer.</li>
</ol>

<p>
As an extreme example, one <a href="https://perma.cc/84BS-KYXB">Honeywell purchase-order form</a>  states at paragraph 13 that:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote Payment terms are <b>net 120 days from receipt</b> of a <b>Honeywell-approved</b> invoice unless otherwise stated on the face of the Purchase Order or other written agreement executed by both parties. &#x2026; Payment will be <b>scheduled for the first payment cycle following</b> the net terms for the Purchase Order. #+end_quot <cite> This Honeywell purchase-order form is archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/84BS-KYXB">https://perma.cc/84BS-KYXB</a>; emphasis and extra paragraphing added.

A.&nbsp; The Con&shy;tract could specifically require payment, for example:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>that newer forms of payment are allowed, e.g., by Zelle (an inter-bank program) or Venmo; and/or</li>

<h6 id="org991eb90">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org991eb90">
<p>
A.&nbsp; The term <i>offset</i> (or <i>setoff</i> or <i>set-off</i>) generally refers to the payer's reducing the amount of a payment by an amount purportedly owed <i>to the payer</i> by the biller. This can sometimes be the subject of dispute. EXAMPLE: Grocery retailer Kroger successfully offset nearly $1.8 million that Kroger owed to a trucking company because the trucking company had failed to comply with an indemnity obligation — the obligation was triggered when a subcontractor of the trucking company hit a minivan head-on, killing three people, leading to a lawsuit against various defendants including Kroger. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7417422738863152843">Diamond Transp.

A.&nbsp; This is a guardrail provision: It recognizes that parties have sometimes been known to get "creative" about their (alleged) entitlement to payment. EXAMPLE: One such case arose between a British billionnaire's brother and a cousin, leading to litigation. <cite> The cousin's firm was to be paid a "success fee" if he sold the family's conglomerate — no sale ever happened, but the cousin demanded payment anyway.

<ul class="org-ul">

<p>
When an ordinary check is written, the money stays in the Payer's account until the check is "presented" to the Payer's bank for payment.

See generally <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/check.asp">Check</a> (Investopedia.com).

Payment by automated clearing house ("ACH") is an electronic debit transaction in lieu of a check. <cite> See generally <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ach.asp">Automated Clearing House (ACH)</a> (Investopedia.com); for international transactions, see <a href="https://stripe.com/resources/more/what-is-swift">SWIFT</a> (Stripe.com). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> As with <a href="#pmt-chk-cmt">payment by check</a> (<a href="#pmt-chk-cmt">9.9.8.3</a>), if the Payer files for U.S. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp">bankruptcy</a> protection before the check clears, then the check might never clear.

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> It's a bad idea to include, <i>in the Con&shy;tract itself</i>, Biller's bank-account information for ACH  transaction: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Con&shy;tract might someday be disclosed to others, such as in a due-diligence effort.</li>

<li>The Con&shy;tract might someday become publicly available — such as the Payer's having to file the contract with the SEC as a "material agreement" but failing to ask for confidential treatment of the bank-account information.</li>

<li>It's not unknown for one party to expose another party's confidential information to the public by filing the information with the SEC.<sup><a id="fnr.MartinMari" class="footref" href="#fn.MartinMari" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup> (See Option § <a href="#nda-public-filings-option">11.3.33.4</a> to Protocol <a href="#r-conf-info-proto">11.3</a> concerning confidential information, which addresses the possibility of such disclosures.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
In such a situation, the Biller's bank-account information could end up available to an unknown number of others.

<p>
A <i>certified</i> check is written by the Payer and drawn on the <i>Payer's</i> bank account, <i>but</i> the bank guarantees to the Biller that the bank has <i>put a hold</i> on Payer's account for the amount of the check.

</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> With a certified check, the money stays in the Payer's account until the check clears; this means that the same bankruptcy issues exist as for <a href="#pmt-chk-cmt">regular checks</a> (<a href="#pmt-chk-cmt">9.9.8.3</a>).
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> Certified checks can be counterfeited, in which case the bank might not have to pay, and if the Biller cashes the check, the Biller might have to refund the money (that's probably in the bank's standard customer agreement that the Biller had to sign to open an account with the bank).

A <i>cashier's</i> check is written <i>by the bank itself using funds in the Bank's own account</i>, not the Payer's account: When writing <i>that</i> check, the bank <i>transfers</i> the stated amount of money from the Payer's account to the bank's own account.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-pmt-inv-chall">
<p>
In this Protocol, § <a href="#r-pmt-inv-disp">9.8</a> doesn't set a fixed deadline for a Payer to challenge a Biller invoice. But the Payer shouldn't string the Biller along with unspecified grumbling about the invoice while withholding payment. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Delaware case, the trial court held that a customer was liable for certain unpaid vendor invoices because the customer had <i>complained</i> about invoices, but the customer had not <i>challenged</i> the invoices within the time prescribed by the contract. The court observed: "Voicing displeasure and asking for accountability is not the same as challenging [the vendor's] right to payment." The court continued: "Trimble's right to directly challenge the invoiced amounts sunsetted pursuant to the [contract's] plain terms." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1518981939899646727">Outbox Sys., Inc. v. Trimble, Inc.</a>, No. N21C-11-123, slip op. at part IV.A.1 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 30, 2024) (decision after trial). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Moreover, § <a href="#r-pmt-inv-disp">9.8</a>'s requirement of a timely explanation, in subdivision B, is just good-neighbor behavior: The Payer <i>might</i> be tempted not to say anything until the Biller asks, "hey, where's our money?" and/or to withhold <i>all</i> payment, in either case, as a cynical way of increasing the Payer's leverage and extending the payment terms. That kind of nickel-and-diming behavior, though, shouldn't happen in a trustworthy- and cooperative business relationship.

It's pretty well established that when the Payer makes a payment under the Con&shy;tract, that in itself doesn't limit any rights that the Payer might have concerning the subject of the payment — such as, for example, warranty rights against the Biller.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Suppose that the Payer hasn't yet paid the Biller's invoice, and that the Payer and the Biller are having a dispute about something relating to the invoice, perhaps about the quality of the Biller's deliveries. The Payer could fear that paying the invoice might be interpreted as acceding to the Biller's position or otherwise prejudicing the Payer's rights. But that shouldn't be the case <i>unless</i> the Payer had clearly agreed otherwise.

<p>
From the other side of the coin: <b>Question:</b> What if you're a supplier and a customer sends you a <i>partial</i> payment that's marked "Payment in Full"? <b>Answer:</b> If you cash the check, you might very well be stuck — possibly losing out on a very-large amount due. <cite> See, e.g., Scott Wolfe, Jr., <a href="https://www.levelset.com/blog/beware-checks-payment-in-full-memo-mechanics-lien-rights">Are Checks with “Payment in Full” in Memo Line Legally Binding? &#x2026;</a> (Levelset.com 2019 & 2021); Sara Lipowitz, <a href="https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/consumer-protection/banking-and-loans/paid-in-full-check-memo.html">'Paid in Full' Check Memo</a> (Lawyers.com 2020). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The insurance carrier United HealthCare of Texas found itself stuck with a <i>$24,000</i> settlement of United's <i>$2 million</i> overpayment claim against a physicians' group:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>United asserted that the physicians' group had been overpaid by some $2 million.</li>

<li>As a settlement offer, the physicians' group sent — to United's lockbox contractor, Wells Fargo — a check for $24,000, marked "Full and final payment" of the dispute. The physicians' group also sent copies of the settlement proposal to multiple United addressees, including United's in-house counsel.</li>

<li>As United's lockbox contractor, Wells Fargo automatically cashed the settlement check.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A Texas court held that United had ample notice that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the check was part of a settlement proposal, and</li>
<li>had United exercised due diligence, it would have had ample time to stop its lockbox contractor, Wells Fargo, from cashing the check.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore, said the court, United was bound by the settlement offer — and thus recovered only $24,000 of what United claimed had been United's $2 million overpayment to the physicians' group. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7440493379200151872">United Healthcare of Texas, Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-pmt-order">
<p>
It'd be fairly typical for the Biller to apply payments under a contract to the Payer's then-unpaid payment obligations — in the order of date incurred — as follows: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; First: The money paid would be used to pay off any accrued but unpaid interest; 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; Then: Any money left over would be applied to reduce the unpaid principal balance. <cite> See generally David Cook, <a href="https://calawyers.org/publications/business-law/business-law-news-2014-issue-3-the-interest-tail-wags-the-profit-dog/">The Interest Tail Wags the Profit Dog</a>, <i>Business Law News,</i> Issue No. 3, 2014 (State Bar of California Business Law Section; available on-line to Section members). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Order-of-payment language is often seen in promissory notes and other loan documents, and sometimes in contract language allowing interest to be charged for past-due payments (concerning which, see <a href="#r-interest-top">9.6</a>).

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-pmt-late-not-infr">
<p>
In theory, being an IP infringer, due to late payment, could have serious financial consequences: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Suppose that a customer were late in paying the price of a <i>patented</i>- or <i>copyrighted</i> product purchased from a vendor.</li>
<li>The vendor <i>could</i> try to claim that the customer's <i>unpaid use</i> of the product constituted infringement of the vendor's intellectual-property rights — and that the customer therefore owed the vendor a portion of the customer's profits as indirect damages <i>for the infringement</i>, not merely as damages for breach of contract.</li>
</ul>


<p>
I'm not aware of any cases specifically on point. But some well-known companies have been hit with such profits-as-indirect-damages awards for analogous conduct, including for example the air-conditioning company Carrier,<sup><a id="fnr.IPCarrier" class="footref" href="#fn.IPCarrier" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup> the MGM Grand Hotel,<sup><a id="fnr.PmtLateIP" class="footref" href="#fn.PmtLateIP" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup> and the Allstate insurance company.<sup><a id="fnr.IPAllstate" class="footref" href="#fn.IPAllstate" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup>

A.&nbsp; This kind of importuning language ("charging the illegal interest was just a <i>mistake</i>!") can work in <b>some</b> jurisdictions such as <b>Texas</b>, which allow parties to reduce the chances of usury problems by agreeing in advance to take certain actions in case of unlawful interest charges. <cite> See generally <a href="https://sdllaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/USURY-AND-HOW-TO-AVOID-IT_.pdf">Spence</a> (SDLLaw.com 2020) (with extensive citations to Texas case law). </cite>

<p>
<b>But</b> such importunings might well have little or no effect in jurisdictions such as <b>Michigan</b><sup><a id="fnr.UsuryMI" class="footref" href="#fn.UsuryMI" role="doc-backlink">16</a></sup> and <b>New York</b><sup><a id="fnr.UsuryNY" class="footref" href="#fn.UsuryNY" role="doc-backlink">17</a></sup> (the latter of which apparently brushes off usury-savings clauses entirely, although New York's usury laws do contain significant exceptions). 
</p>

<p>
The policy behind unenforceability of usury-savings clauses was explained by the <b>District of Columbia</b> Court of Appeals (which is not the federal D.C. Circuit):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It would run contrary to our usury statute to permit creditors to avoid its sting via savings clauses purporting to cap the loan’s interest rate to the maximum allowed by law. <b>The animating force of usury statutes is to relieve the <i>borrower</i> of the necessity for expertise and vigilance regarding the legality of rates he must pay, putting that onus instead on the <i>lender</i> to set the rate in clear terms that are within the bounds of the law.</b> <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14839340999505510316">Sloan v. Allen</a> 323 A.3d 439, 444 (D.C. App. 2024) (cleaned up, formatting edited). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, <b>Rhode Island</b>'s supreme court acknowledged that the state's usury statute was "draconian" and "strong medicine," because the legislature had put the risk of charging too high an interest rate onto the lender in "an inflexible, hardline approach to usury that is tantamount to strict liability &#x2026;." The court affirmed a trial-court ruling that a commercial loan agreement for more than $400,000 was void as usurious. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5658134079581893180">LaBonte v.

A.&nbsp; This "first to any remaining principal balance" approach can be seen in a number of in-the-wild usury savings clauses. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/usury-savings-clause">these clauses</a> (LawInsider.com). </cite>

A.&nbsp; Here are a few examples of charges that were held <i>not</i> to constitute usurious interest under Texas law:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A bank's service fee for a bounced check (an "NSF charge"); <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17610818493077067844">First Bk. v. Tony's Tortilla Factory, Inc.</a>, 877 S.W.2d 285, 285 (Tex. 1994). </cite></li>

B.&nbsp; In <i>Southwest Concrete</i> (1990), California's supreme court ruled that the state's usury law does not cover interest charged on overdue commercial accounts. As explained in <i>Sunstate</i> (Cal. App. 2023), the contract at issue in <i>Southwest Concrete</i>, for rental of construction equipment, allowed the renter to be charged interest on late payments at 18% per year. The supreme court ruled that:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the state's usury law limits the interest payable <i>for the loan or forbearance of money</i>; and</li>
<li>the substance of the transaction did not have "as its true object the hire of money at an excessive rate</li>

<p>
of interest." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14401748721321056835">Southwest Concrete Prods. v. Gosh Constr.

<p>
C.&nbsp; Relatedly: Some professional athletes have sold the right to receive a percentage of the athletes' future earnings in return for an upfront payment. Such an arrangement has been referred to as an "income purchase agreement," resembling a venture-capital investment agreement. For example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As a minor leaguer, Fernando Tatis, Jr. received (reportedly) a $2 million advance from a buyer, Big League Advance (which was started by a former MLB pitcher) in exchange for 10% of his future earnings.</li>

<li>Tatis later signed a $340 million contract extension with the San Diego Padres — which would have entitled the buyer to more than $30 million from the arrangement.</li>

<li>Tatis sued to void the contract; at this writing, the suit is pending. <cite> See Timothy Hurley, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-cost-of-an-early-payday-lessons-1665323/">The Cost of An Early Payday: Lessons from Tatis Jr.'s Advance Financing Agreement</a> (JDSupra.com 2025); Associated Press, <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45571919/padres-fernando-tatis-jr-sues-big-league-advance-void-future-earnings-deal-signed-minor-leaguer">Padres' Tatis sues Big League Advance to void deal signed at 17</a> (ESPN.com 2025). </cite></li>

<p>
When this Protocol is agreed to, then one party to the Con&shy;tract (the "<b>Biller</b>" — which must be clearly identified in the Con&shy;tract),
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>has the right — for <a href="#adv-pmt-gdrsn">good reason</a> — to require payment <i>in advance</i>,</li>

<li>for goods, services, or anything else,</li>

<li>from another party (the "<b>Payer</b>" — which must likewise be clearly identified),</li>

<li>even if the Con&shy;tract says that the Payer may pay at a particular time or on a particular schedule.</li>

<h6 id="org5db9c3b">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org5db9c3b">
<p>
A.&nbsp; If you're representing a vendor (the Biller), you might <i>not</i> want your draft of the Con&shy;tract to adopt this Protocol.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Here's the "yes you would" scenario: One of your vendor client's customers (the Payer) proves to be a slow payer — see <a href="#bkup-pmt-ex">9.2.11.1</a> for some famous examples — and at some point the vendor says, <i>Enough already!</i> This Protocol provides your vendor client with a framework for demanding payment in advance for future orders from that customer.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; But here's the "maybe not" part: You should also think about whether to not propose adopting this Protocol in the Con&shy;tract. That's because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>The law</i> might already permit your vendor client to revert to cash-on-delivery ("C.O.D.") or advance-payment terms if the customer's late payments constituted a "material" breach of the contract (see the definition of <i>material breach</i> at Protocol <a href="#matl-br-stip">20.6.1.5</a> and its commentary).</li>

<li>Just raising the issue with the customer could have an unwanted, "poke the bear" side effect (see <a href="#poke-bear">30.14</a>): It could remind the customer's contract negotiator to insist on revising the draft contract to <i>override</i> what the law says, in a way that might disadvantage your vendor client.</li>

<h4 id="adv-pmt-gdrsn"><span class="section-number-4">10.2.2.</span> Possible instances of good reason</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-adv-pmt-gdrsn">
<p>
In appropriate circumstances, <i>good reason</i> for the Biller's demanding advance payment might include — without limitation — one or more of the following: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Payer was late more than once in making payments required in connection with the Con&shy;tract.</li>

<li>The Payer was significantly late — as reasonably determined by the Biller — with one or more such required payments.</li>

<li>The Payer wants to place an unusually-large order.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org691e039" class="outline-6 cmtry">
<h6 id="org691e039">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org691e039">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Whether you're representing a Biller or a Payer, it might <i>not</i> be a profitable use of your time to try to authoritatively <i>define</i> the term <i>good reason</i> in the Con&shy;tract — other than perhaps including some safe-harbor examples stating that Particular Thing‑X is or isn't <i>deemed</i> good reason.  For example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The parties might never get into a dispute about advance payment, so deferring discussion of the term could help the parties to get the Con&shy;tract signed more quickly.</li>

<li>Protocol <a href="#r-adv-pmt">10.2</a> already provides for escalation of disputes; this follows the general guideline: <i>If you don't want to (or just can't) specify the agreed <b>outcome</b> now, then consider specifying an agreed <b>process</b> to figure it out later</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Moreover, as a practical matter, even without defining <i>good reason</i>, the Biller might hold <i>some</i> high cards: Depending on the parties' bargaining power, the Biller might simply refuse to do whatever the Payer was asking for unless the Payer complied with the Biller's new advance-payment requirement.

<h4 id="adv-pmt-alert"><span class="section-number-4">10.2.3.</span> Advance warning</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-adv-pmt-alert">
<p>
The Payer may treat the existing payment terms of the Con&shy;tract as still being in effect unless — a reasonable time in advance — the Biller alerts the Payer (preferably but not necessarily in writing) that advance payment will be required. 
</p>

<p>
A reasonable time in advance might be as short as when an order is placed. <i>Example:</i> The Biller gets a purchase order from the Payer, but the Biller responds, "Hey, we're sorry, Payer, but in view of your payment history, we're going to have to ask for advance payment." That would depend on the circumstances.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-r-drawbk">
<p>
Generally speaking, a "drawback" is a refund of duties or fees that a country might charge on <i>imports</i> of goods if those goods are <i>re-exported</i> in forms specified by local law, as an incentive for creating jobs in the local economy. As journalist Binyamin Appelbaum explained, aluminum components in a car might have started out as bauxite (aluminum ore) that is "mined and refined in Jamaica, shipped to northern Quebec for smelting, then hammered into car parts in Alcoa, Tenn." <cite> Binyamin Appelbaum, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/us/politics/american-companies-still-make-aluminum-in-iceland.html">American Companies Still Make Aluminum.

</p>

<p>
Those two pieces of the deal took centerstage over the past three weeks in Harris County District Judge Michael Gomez’s courtroom as <b>a jury worked to discern</b> two things: <b>whether Odessa Pumps acted in bad faith in the way it managed Flex Flow to avoid having to pay the earnout</b>, and whether GR violated the noncompete agreement through its communications with SpaceX about a potential pump deal.
</p>

<p>
Jurors deliberated for a few hours before <b>determining Tuesday that Odessa Pumps had not acted in bad faith</b> and that GR had not violated the noncompete agreement. They did not reach a third question, where GR had sought $29.8 million in damages for Odessa Pump’s alleged bad faith actions.

&#x2013;  EXAMPLE:  <i>Northbound Group v.

<p>
&#x2013;  Delaware's supreme court largely upheld a $1 billion Chancery-Court judgment that Johnson & Johnson had breached an earn-out provision in a contract by which J&J acquired Auris, one of J&J's potential competitors in the medical-robotics field (in which J&J had indirectly invested). Two of J&J's principal earn-out breaches were: (1) running a head-to-head "bake-off" competition between Auris's da Vinci robotic surgical platform and another J&J-affiliated system, instead of pursuing the agreed minimum-viable product ("MVP") strategy to continue development of the Auris system; and (2) merging the da Vinci system with the J&J system — these breaches led to extensive development delays and thus to Auris's missing milestones to qualify for some $2.35 billion in earn-out payments. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12056670684212718028">Johnson & Johnson v.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-gross-up">
<p>
In some contracts, it might be part of the parties' bargain for the paying party to "gross up" its payments to another party, so that the recipient's <i>net</i> amount received is equal to a stated amount. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> It's not a matter of paying just the additional amount due for the tax on the underlying amount, but <i>another</i> additional amount to cover the tax on the <i>first</i> additional amount. The Investopedia entry <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross-up.asp">Grossing up</a> includes a "worked example" with hypothetical numbers for a company to gross up an employee's $100K salary to cover an income-tax rate of 20%:  The company must pay the employee an additional <i>$25K</i> on top of the employee's $100K salary, not just an additional $20K, because the employee will owe income tax on the $20K amount as well.

<p>
EXAMPLE: As a non-tax example, a commercial landlord might charge the tenants of a building with a pro-rata share of the building's operating expenses based, not on <i>actual</i> percentage occupancy, but on 95% to 100% occupancy, so that the tenants, not the landlord, are covering those costs. (Of course, tenants might have a different opinion about whether the landlord should be able to offload, onto the tenants, a portion of the landlord's financial risk that part of the building might be sitting empty &#x2026;.) <cite> See Lauren Beames and Laura Walda, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/grossing-up-operating-expenses-in-9476652">"Grossing-Up" Operating Expenses in Commercial Leases</a> (JDSupra.com 2023). </cite>

Suppose that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> agree that <i>A</i> will share in the <i>profits</i> from <i>B</i>'s business — <i>after</i> <i>B</i> deducts its expenses. This type of "net profit" is common in movie- and TV-series production deals, where actors, producers, and others get (percentage) "points" that can add up to large sums over time. <cite> See generally Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting">Hollywood Accounting</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Obviously, in this type of arrangement, <i>B</i> has an incentive to take as many deductions from gross revenue as it can, to try to reduce its payout to <i>A</i>.

An online commenter once opined that in Hollywood:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Net points:</b> These are about as valuable, and confer as much status, as collecting beads for taking your top off at mardi gras. Everyone gets them and they're never worth anything. Along with whatever fee an actor — or a director, producer, writer — gets for a film, they may get some net points thrown in. What it means is a percentage of the profits of a movie after it has recouped all its costs. Since even the mafia envies the ability of studios to cook their books, movies never go into profit. Ever. There are all sorts of charges — production costs, marketing costs, distribution fees, fuck-you-because-we-say-so write-offs — that can make the biggest hit look like a dog. <cite> Gabriel Snyder, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090417025016/https://gawker.com/5196154/how-movie-stars-get-paid">How Movie Stars Get Paid</a> (archive.org, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker_Media">now-defunct</a> Gawker.com 2009; extra paragraphing added).

Deutsche Bank</a>; no copyright is claimed in the opinion's text.</i>
</p>


<p>
A letter of credit is an irrevocable promise to pay the beneficiary when the latter presents certain documents that conform with the terms of the credit letter. Its purpose is to facilitate international trade by reducing the risk of nonpayment in cases where credit is extended by interposing a known and solvent institution's credit for that of an unknown and potentially insolvent institution.
</p>

<p>
One of the expected advantages and essential purposes of a letter of credit is that the beneficiary will be able to rely on assured, prompt payment from a solvent party; necessarily, a part of this expectation of ready payment is that there will be a minimum of litigation and judicial interference, and this is one of the reasons for the value of the letter of credit device in financial transactions.
</p>

<p>
Ordinarily there are three separate and distinct contracts involved in a letter of credit transaction:
</p>

<p>
1.  the contract of the bank with its customer whereby it agrees to issue the letter of credit;
</p>

<p>
2.  the letter of credit itself; and
</p>

<p>
3.  the contract of sale between the buyer (who is also the person who procured the bank to issue the letter of credit) and the seller (who accepts and acts under the letter of credit by drawing drafts thereunder). 
</p>

<p>
<i>Independence principle:</i> A letter of credit is independent from the underlying transaction that gave rise to it. The issuing bank's payment obligation to the beneficiary is primary, direct and completely independent of any claims which may arise in the underlying sale of goods transaction. 
</p>

<p>
It is the complete separation between the underlying commercial transaction and the letter of credit that gives the letter its utility in financing transactions. This independence principle is predicated upon the fundamental policy that a letter of credit would lose its commercial vitality if, before honoring drafts, the issuer could look beyond the terms of the credit to the underlying contractual controversy or performance between its customer and the beneficiary.
</p>

<p>
<i>Strict enforcement principle:</i> Additionally, letters of credit are strictly enforced pursuant to their terms. Where a beneficiary's draw request complies with the terms of the letter of credit, the issuer's duty to pay is absolute, regardless of whether the buyer-account party complains that the goods are nonconforming. This rule of strict compliance finds justification in the bank's role in the transaction being ministerial, and to require it to determine the substantiality of discrepancies would be inconsistent with its function.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fraud &#x2013; a limited exception:</i> Fraud is the well-established exception to the rules of independence and strict compliance under letter of credit law. Dishonor due to fraud is proper:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>where a draw has no basis in fact and represents a fraud in the transaction, or</li>

<li>where a drawdown would amount to an outright fraudulent practice by the beneficiary.</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, because the smooth operation of international commerce requires that requests for payment under letters of credit not be routinely obstructed by pre-payment litigation, the fraud exception to the independence principle is a narrow one.
</p>

<p>
Under the "fraud in the transaction" defense, dishonor of a facially-conforming draw request is permissible only where the beneficiary's claim is clearly untenable. Similarly, a drawdown amounts to "fraud in the transaction" where the beneficiary has no basis in fact and thus the drawer has no bona fide claim to payment at all. Dishonor is permissible due to fraud where the beneficiary attempts to draw on a standby letter of credit when there is no plausible or colorable basis under the contract.

A.&nbsp; Pay-if-paid clauses might not be enforceable in some jurisdictions; see <a href="#PayIfApp">10.9.7.3</a>. </aside>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 3: An explicit assumption of the risk of nonpayment might enhance the enforceability of a pay-<i>if</i>-paid provision. As one Texas court put it: "[T]he risk of non-payment by the owner on a construction contract is not shifted from the contractor to the subcontractor unless there is a clear, unequivocable and expressed agreement between the parties to do so." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=259311616710153416">Gulf Constr.

</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>But:</b> Explicit language, using the exact words "pay if paid" or "assumes the risk of nonpayment" <i>might</i> not be strictly necessary for enforcement of a pay-if-paid clause; an equivalent phrase such as "condition precedent" might suffice. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7771664066876925390">BMD Contractors, Inc. v.

In some jurisdictions, a pay-<i>if</i>-paid clause could mean that the Sub cannot seek payment from a backup payer, or "surety," such as a payment bond, if there is one. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7771664066876925390">BMD Contractors, Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-pay-if-bkup-cmt">
<p>
If the Sub is going to agree to pay-<i>if</i>-paid terms with the Prime, then the Sub should consider asking the Prime to commit to maintaining "payment security" (see Protocol <a href="#r-pmt-sec-addl">9.2</a>) for all amounts to be paid by the Prime — including, without limitation, amounts to be paid under any (accepted) purchase orders issued by the Prime under the Con&shy;tract. (This represents what might be one of the most common "use cases" for payment security.)
</p>

<p>
The Sub might want the payment security to take the form of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit (see the notes at <a href="#nl-ltr-crdt-cmt">10.7</a>), or</li>

<li>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_bond">payment bond</a>,</li>

</p>

<p>
<b>Texas</b>, by statute, has regulated "contingent payment" clauses for certain construction subcontracts; such clauses are unenforceable if "unconscionable," with the statute also providing a safe harbor for contingent payers . <cite> See <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.56.htm">Tex.

<b>But:</b> In many cases, a security interest in collateral must be properly established and "perfected" — the manner of perfection depends on the nature of the collateral; it generally involves filing a notice of some kind in public records, so as to put the public on notice of the payee's security interest.
</p>

<p>
This means that two <b>disadvantages</b> of a security interest are: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Parties don't always get around to doing and/or filing the paperwork to <i>perfect</i> a security interest; and</li>

<li><i>Foreclosing</i> on collateral costs time and money — especially if the collateral owner tries to get a court to stop the process, as sometimes happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bottom line: A security interest is likely not the <i>preferred</i> payment security of choice for suppliers or other payees.

<i>True-up</i> is business jargon for reconciling or balancing; a true-up is generally the end goal of a (routine) audit if the audit reveals that a party overpaid or underpaid.

<p>
Here are a few examples where true-ups likely would be in order:

A.&nbsp; So-called "de-identified" protected health information can be commercially valuable — <b>but</b> its use might be subject to legal restrictions. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Seeing a need, some vendors have produced specialized "clean room" software that anonymizes consumer data. <cite> See generally, e.g., <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html">this HHS guidance</a> on de-identifying PHI; Patience Haggin, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/advertisers-data-clean-rooms-11666038545?st=p888914e1ma1mgo&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">Advertisers Turn to ‘Clean Rooms’ to Keep Consumer Data Private</a> (WSJ.com). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b>  <i>De-identified</i> protected health information <b>isn't the same</b> as <i>aggregated</i> PHI, which this Protocol doesn't address. Under HHS regulations, a business associate may use <i>aggregated</i> PHI only in limited circumstances. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.501">HHS definition</a> of <i>data aggregation</i> provides as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Data aggregation</i> means, with respect to protected health information <b>created or received</b> by a business associate <b>in its capacity</b> as the business associate of a covered entity[:] <b>the combining of</b> such protected health information by the business associate <b>with</b> the protected health information <b>received</b> by the business associate <b>in its capacity</b> as a business associate of <b>another covered entity</b>, to permit <b>data analyses</b> that relate to the <b>health care operations</b> of the respective covered entities. <cite> <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.501">45 C.F.R. § 164.501</a> (emphasis and bullets added). </cite>

<p>
As pointed out by a healthcare lawyer: "Per the regulations and commentary, the 'data aggregation' exception would <span class="underline">not</span> apply <b>unless</b> (1) the data aggregation is for the covered entity’s healthcare operations, <span class="underline">not</span> the business associate’s own purposes; and (2) the BAA expressly authorizes the business associate to perform the data aggregation services." <cite> Kim Stanger, <a href="https://www.hollandhart.com/business-associates-use-of-information-for-their-own-purposes">Business Associates' Use of Information for Their Own Purposes</a> (HollandHart.com 2019) (emphasis added). </cite>

They're everywhere — and they help build deals: Surely the most-common type of contract has to be the confidentiality agreement — commonly referred to (imprecisely) as an "NDA," for "nondisclosure agreement," although NDAs pretty-much always contain more obligations than nondisclosure. As we'll see in the notes below, confidentiality agreements are enforceable at common law and/or by statute in the U.S. and many other countries.

<p>
<i>A</i> to the Con&shy;tract will have the obligations of a "<b>Recipient</b>" of Confidential Information of <i>B</i> to the Con&shy;tract, referred to as a "<b>Discloser</b>," but <b>only if:</b> 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">

<h6 id="orgd2f9184">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgd2f9184">
<p>
A.&nbsp; <i>Intent:</i> This is intended to avoid possibly-severe <i>future</i> problems for the Recipient if: (1) the parties initially agree that only the other party's information will be protected; <b>but</b> (2) the parties later decide to switch roles but don't realize that their NDA doesn't cover that situation.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp;  <i>A genuine two-way agreement is always best:</i> Under the definition in this § <a href="#conf-info-rcpt">11.3.1</a>, this Protocol would be usable both in a <i>one</i>-way agreement (where only one party wants to be bound by confidentiality obligations) <b>and</b> in a <i>two</i>-way agreement. (Concerning two-way agreements, see the additional discussion at <a href="#conf-info-pty">11.3.34.3</a> and, more generally at <a href="#FFri">1.4</a>.)
</p>

<p>
This reverses an oft-used  approach to NDA drafting: We don't "lock in" the definitions of <i>Discloser</i> and then <i>Recipient</i>; instead, we define <i>Recipient</i> as <i>any</i> party that has agreed — in the Con&shy;tract itself, or otherwise — to treat particular information in confidence, to guard against inadvertent disasters later, as discussed at <a href="#conf-info-pty">11.3.34.3</a>.  
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp;  <b>Caution:</b> Both the Recipient <i>and the Discloser</i> might be subject to other confidentiality obligations, possibly by operation of law — see, e.g.:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Business associate agreements (<a href="#r-baa-app">11.2</a>): confidential obligations are required by law in certain cases involving protected health information;</li>

<li>Export controls (<a href="#nl-export-ctrls">28.11</a>): the law restricts disclosure of certain categories of information, <i>with possible criminal penalties for violation</i>;</li>

<li>Privacy laws (<a href="#r-priv-law-defn">11.6</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: Under this Protocol, both the Discloser and the Recipient must be parties <i>to the Con&shy;tract</i>, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it wouldn't be a great idea for a Discloser to assert, out of the blue, that some unsuspecting third party was supposedly bound by confidentiality obligations; and</li>

<li>neither would it be good for an outsider to assert that <b>it</b> qualified as a Discloser and therefore the parties to the Con&shy;tract had misappropriated the outsider's confidential information.</li>
</ul>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: We say nothing here about the Discloser's <i>owning</i> Confidential Information — in that regard, we follow the (federal) Defend Trade Secrets Act, in which, an <i>owner</i> (of a trade secret) is defined as "the person or entity in whom or in which rightful legal or equitable title to, <b>or license in</b>, the trade secret is reposed &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1839">18 U.S.C. § 1839(4)</a> (emphasis added); see, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18031949083791243345">Advanced Fluid Systems, Inc. v. Huber</a>, 958 F.3d 168, 177 (3d Cir. 2020) (affirming judgment of trade-secret misappropriation). </cite>
</p>

<p>
State-law adoptions of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, however, generally refer to a "possessor" of information, not an "owner." <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7746761402349434471">Snyder v.

A.&nbsp; Language choice: This section draws on the (U.S.) Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1839">18 U.S.C. § 1839(3)</a>, which was modeled in part on the state-law Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which has been adopted in nearly all U.S. states. <cite> See generally, e.g., BakerHostetler, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/comparing-the-defend-trade-secrets-act-34379/">Comparing the Defend Trade Secrets Act and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act</a> (JDSupra.com 2016). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Under the law in most jurisdictions, the Discloser (usually) must take reasonable precautions to protect its confidential information — otherwise the information won't be eligible for trade-secret protection in the first place, as discussed in the note to § <a href="#conf-info-excl-free">11.3.11</a>.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Here are some commonly-used security measures for confidential information: <cite> These examples are drawn in part from on Amy E. Bergeron, <a href="https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2021/june/for-good-reason-reasonable-measures-in-recent-trade-secret-law">For Good Reason: “Reasonable Measures” in Recent Trade Secret Law</a> (BakerBotts.com 2021). </cite>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keep hard copies in locked offices and/or in locked file cabinets.</li>
<li>Require passwords (and, increasingly, <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/use-two-factor-authentication-protect-your-accounts">two-factor authentication</a> or <a href="https://safety.google/authentication/passkey/">passkeys</a>) to access computer networks.</li>
<li>Use role-based permissions on computer networks; for example, marketing people might not need to see — and so perhaps shouldn't have access to — technical information, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Be careful about the increasingly-popular practice of "BYOD" (Bring Your Own</li>
</ul>
<p>
Device), especially if it will be difficult to get an employee to delete confidential information from a personal phone or computer when leaving the company. EXAMPLE: The Eleventh Circuit affirmed a ruling that a company had destroyed its rights in certain trade secrets when it adopted a loose BYOD policy with its employees. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11504598804363916388">Yellowfin Yachts, Inc. v. Barker Boatworks LLC</a>, 893 F.3d 1279, 1299, 1300-01 (11th Cir. 2018) (affirming summary judgment). </cite>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When an employee quits or is fired or laid off: Quickly cut off the employee's access to computers and networks, and direct the employee to delete confidential informtion from personal devices. EXAMPLE: Google executive Anthony Levandowski left the company to found a self-driving truck startup company, Otto (later acquired by Uber). On his way out the door, Levandowski "downloaded thousands of <i>[trade-secret Google]</i> files onto his personal laptop. He also admitted downloading a variety of files from a corporate Google Drive repository." (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-uber-executive-sentenced-18-months-jail-trade-secret-theft-google">DOJ press release</a>.) Levandowski pleaded guilty to trade-secret theft and was sentenced to 18 months in prison (but was pardoned by President Trump on the morning of the day Trump left office in his first term). In addition to the criminal charges against Levandowski, Google sued both him and Uber in civil court; the parties eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/15/inside-the-uber-and-google-settlement-with-anthony-levandowski/">settled</a> the case.</li>
<li>Consider using security cameras in appropriate places.</li>
</ul>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b> Fort-Knox security measures usually <b>aren't</b> necessary. EXAMPLE: The Tenth Circuit once remarked that "there always are more security precautions that can be taken. Just because there is something else that Luzenac could have done does not mean that their efforts were unreasonable under the circumstances. &#x2026; Whether these [specific] precautions were, in fact, reasonable, will have to be decided by a jury." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10923646552861580590">Hertz v. Luzenac Group</a>, 576 F.3d 1103, 1113 (10th Cir. 2009) (cleaned up; citations omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In one case, the defendants, Meta and Princeton University, moved for summary judgment that the plaintiff's exposure on its Web site of the alleged trade secrets was enough to defeat any claim for trade-secret misappropriation. The court, though, held that the robotic "scraping" of the plaintiff's Web site — initiated by Princeton University researchers in violation of the Web site's terms of service — was a factor in denying <i>summary</i> judgment about whether the plaintiff had taken sufficient protective measures, and so a full-blown trial would be needed to determine that issue. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1738358582000644661">UAB "Planner5D" v. Meta</a>, No. 3-19-cv-03132, 2021 WL 1405482 (N.D. Cal. 2023), part II.D.3; see also the court's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16123900623584444283">2019 factual summary</a>; the case was <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-cand-3_19-cv-03132/pdf/USCOURTS-cand-3_19-cv-03132-11.pdf">settled</a> in 2025. </cite>
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; A confidentiality legend, by itself, might not suffice as reasonable secrecy measures. EXAMPLE: A federal court in San Antonio held that "the only reasonable measure plaintiffs allegedly took to keep the information secret was a confidentiality statement at the bottom of an email. A boilerplate confidentiality statement does not constitute a reasonable measure to keep secrecy—especially when [the plaintiff] used the phrase "<i>may</i> contain information that is confidential." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8285858950124467836">Academy of Allergy & Asthma in Primary Care v. Quest Diagnostics, Inc.</a>, No. 5:17-cv-1295-RCL, slip op. at part III.D (W.D. Tex. Mar. 31, 2022) (granting Quest's motion to dismiss trade-secret claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted), <i>on remand from</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5762416659333775742">998 F. 3d 190, 199</a> (5th Cir. 2021) (reversing district court's dismissal, on limitation grounds, of trade-secret claims; cleaned up, case citations omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; <b>Importantly:</b> Whether a company took <i>reasonable</i> measures to protect its confidential information will often be a jury issue. As a result, if there's <i>enough</i> evidence of such measures to allow a jury to conclude that the measures were indeed reasonable, then (in American practice) neither the trial judge nor the appellate court will disturb the jury's conclusion, even if a different conclusion might also have been reasonable. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/24-20460/24-20460-2026-01-21.html">Trinseo v.

<h6 id="org21bc711">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org21bc711">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: A Discloser likely won't want the Recipient's confidentiality obligations to expire for <i>economically-valuable</i> confidential information, because that would almost surely <b>destroy the Discloser's legal rights</b> in the information (see the note below). This exclusion from expiration is a "sunset" provision that tries to compromise between the parties' interests, as discussed in the note below.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 3.b:  A designation by the Discloser could happen during initial disclosure, for example by labeling a written copy of the information as a trade secret.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 4's notice requirement is meant to increase the chances that the Recipient will actually become aware of a catch-up designation of non-expiration.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <i>Shouldn't even trade-secret confidentiality obligations expire?</i>  The Discloser is likely to balk at across-the-board expiration of the Recipient's confidentiality obligations. That's because such broad expiration would likely destroy the Discloser's legal rights in any trade secrets that the Discloser had provided under the NDA, i.e., information that gave the Discloser an economic advantage from its secrecy. That could be a serious concern.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a case peripherally involving Facebook, the Ninth Circuit reversed a trial-court's judgment awarding $30 million for breach of an NDA because the NDA's confidentiality obligations had unambiguously ended two years after NDA was signed due to a "sunset" provision in the NDA itself. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3494441462132744599">BladeRoom Grp. Ltd. v. Emerson Elec. Co.</a>, 20 F.4th 1231 (9th Cir. 2021). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Other cases are to like effect. EXAMPLE: In a Commerzbank AG case, the <a href="https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">SDNY</a> noted that: "Once <i>a third party's</i> confidentiality obligation &#x2026; expires, so does the trade secret protection." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2274485279618406396">Structured Capital Solutions v. Commerzbank AG</a>, 177 F. Supp. 3d 816, 835-36 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (Rakoff, J., granting summary judgment for Commerzbank on plaintiff's trade-secret claim; citing cases) (emphasis added). See also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4113830940179918000">Analog Technologies, Inc. v. Analog Devices, Inc.</a>, 105 F.4th 13 (1st Cir. 2024) (granting motion to dismiss); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16534337829396872833">DB Riley, Inc. v. AB Eng'g Corp.</a>, 977 F. Supp. 84, 91 (D. Mass. 1997) (denying preliminary injunction against alleged trade-secret misappropriation). </cite>
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; And of course, for both trade secrets and other Confidential Information, the Recipient's obligations would automatically end if, at any time, the information in question were to come with one of the Confidential Information exclusion categories starting at § <a href="#r-conf-info-proto">11.3</a>.
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Even after expiration of confidentiality obligations under the Con&shy;tract, other law concerning, e.g., privacy or export controls might still restrict the Recipient's use- and/or disclosure of information.
</p>

<p>
G.&nbsp; <i>Why not just say that <b>all</b> information is a trade secret?</i> A Discloser might assert that <i>all</i> confidential information that the Discloser makes available to a Recipient should be <i>presumed</i> to be a trade secret. The Fourth Circuit rejected a manufacturer's urging that all confidential information that the manufacturer had disclosed to a distributor should be presumed to be a trade secret; the court cited the business- and economic mischief that could result from opportunistic claims of misappropriation. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1086245443301970817">Sysco Machinery Corp. v. DCS USA Corp.</a>, 143 F.4th 222, 230-31 (4th Cir. 2025) (affirming dismissal of trade-secret claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted) </cite>
</p>

<p>
#+begin_comment
</p>

<p>
On Sysco’s view, we should presume that nearly all information a manufacturer considers confidential is a trade secret and that nearly all distributors who sell a manufacturer’s products and then begin selling those of a competitor are liable for misappropriation. We decline to adopt those presumptions.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Doing so would disincentivize businesses from setting clear, mutually agreeable contractual expectations with their vendors and suppliers about how their information should be handled.</li>

<li>It would, instead, incentivize them to leave the terms of their arrangement ambiguous and then allege misappropriation whenever the relationship sours.</li>
<li>Many of our economy’s most commonplace relationships would erupt in tort litigation.</li>

<p>
H.&nbsp; <i>A compromise:</i> In this Protocol, § <a href="#conf-info-expir">11.3.5</a> provides a "sunset" as a compromise that attempts to balance the parties' competing interests: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Recipient, for its own business efficiency, will likely want to have its confidentiality obligations expire on an easily-determinable date. That way, after that "sunset" date, the Recipient won't have to worry about whether particular "ordinary" confidential information is still subject to such obligations, because it won't have to think about the question.</li>

<li>For trade secrets, § <a href="#conf-info-expir">11.3.5</a> gives the Discloser a reasonable opportunity to exclude valuable information from the expiration of the Recipient's confidentiality obligations. That section's written-designation requirement is based on court holdings that someone claiming trade-secret rights must specify just what information supposedly constitutes a trade secret.<sup><a id="fnr.TSDesig" class="footref" href="#fn.TSDesig" role="doc-backlink">19</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>
I.&nbsp; <i>When should confidentiality obligations expire?</i> For non-trade-secret information, confidentiality obligations could expire, for example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>on the date X years after all copies of the information have been returned or destroyed; or</li>

<li>on the date X years after the effective date of termination or expiration of the Con&shy;tract — this latter alternative can be problematic, however, because the Con&shy;tract <i>per se</i> might not <i>have</i> an expiration date, and the parties might forget to terminate it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
J.&nbsp; <i>Why not just have all confidentiality obligations be perpetual?</i> <b>Caution:</b> The law might invalidate <i>perpetual</i> confidentiality obligations — at least for non-trade-secret confidential information. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3960306576904580586">Meta Platforms, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
On the other hand: The Eighth Circuit affirmed a holding that defendants had breached a seemingly-perpetual contractual confidentiality obligation that read, "I shall <i>never</i>, either during my employment with the Company <i>or thereafter</i>, directly or indirectly use . . . confidential information acquired in the course of my employment activities." <cite> <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca8/23-3335/23-3335-2025-06-24.pdf#page=8.15">Crabar/GBF, Inc. v.

<h6 id="orgf691244">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgf691244">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: For various business reasons, parties often want the mere fact that they are in discussions to remain confidential, let alone the details of their dealings. Their motives might include, for example: • wanting to keep pricing information secret from competitors; or • not wanting to trigger a bidding war in a prospective merger- or acquisition transaction. (<i>Public</i> information about the parties' dealings would of course not be Confidential Information.) 
</p>

<p>
A.&nbsp; <i>Wording can matter here:</i> <b>Caution:</b> Drafters should carefully consider the <i>wording</i> of a confidentiality-of-dealings clause. Incautious wording could fail to protect what a party is <i>really</i> concerned about.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Something like that seems to have happened in a Texas case: A woman agreed to settle a wrongful-death claim against a doctor who had treated the woman's daughter. The settlement agreement barred the woman from talking about the settlement, but it didn't restrict her discussion of the doctor's alleged malpractice. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=986788066254913571">Joselevitz v. Roane</a>, No. 14-18-00172-CV, slip op. at n.3. (Tex. App.–Houston [14th Dist.] Mar. 31, 2020) (affirming take-nothing summary judgment dismissing doctor's breach-of-contract and defamation claims against woman) (mem. op.) </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <i>A secrecy-of-dealings clause would likely be enforced:</i> Clauses requiring parties' contract terms to be kept confidential have been enforced. EXAMPLE: The Delaware chancery court held that a party had materially breached an agreement by publicly disclosing the agreement's terms in violation of a confidentiality clause — thereby justifying the other party's termination of the agreement. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10089366460764636035">eCommerce Indus., Inc. v. MWA Intelligence, Inc.</a>, No. 7471-VCP, part II-A, text acc. notes 117 et seq. (Del. Ch. Oct. 4, 2013). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; COUNTEREXAMPLE: On the other hand, a party's breach of a confidentiality-of-dealings clause might not be considered "material." For example, Delaware's supreme court held that in a patent license agreement, a provision requiring the terms of the license to be kept confidential was <i>not</i> material, because the <i>gravamen</i> of the contract was the patent license, not the confidentiality provision; as a result, when the licensee publicly disclosed the royalty terms, the patent owner was not entitled to terminate the license agreement for material breach. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16872484994407384380">Qualcomm Inc. v. Texas Instr. Inc.</a>, 875 A.2d 626, 628 (Del. 2005) (affirming holding of chancery court). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Similarly, Amazon was found liable for breaching a letter of intent to negotiate a lease of a commercial building in Manhattan. On summary judgment, the court noted: "Paragraph 27 prohibited Amazon from disclosing the LOI and the parties' negotiations to third-parties" (text accompanying n.1) but that "[t]hough the confidentially provision was also breached, it did not result in additional out-of-pocket damages, making the breach academic." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=883747245371168509">DOLP 1133 Properties II LLC v.

D.&nbsp; <i>Secrecy of dealings: Could government authorities object?</i> Government authorities might object to confidentiality-of-dealings clauses, for example in employment-agreement forms that call for the employee to keep confidential all information about salary, bonus, and other compensation; see <a href="#c-ConfInfoLegalRestr">11.3.35.3</a> for a detailed discussion.

B.&nbsp; Counterexample: <a id="org8950ca8"></a> <i>Christopher</i> (1970) represents perhaps an extreme case of a court holding that leaving trade-secret information out in the open, where it could be observed from the air, did not constitute failing to take reasonable precautions:

&#x2013;  Chemical manufacturer DuPont built a plant near Beaumont, Texas.

<p>
&#x2013;  During the construction, DuPont employees noticed a small plane circling the site.

&#x2013;  The company's investigation led to father-and-son photographers who had been hired, by an unknown party, to overfly — in public, unrestricted airspace — and photograph the site, allegedly for the purpose of gaining information about a highly-secret DuPont process for producing methanol.
</p>

<p>
The district court ruled that DuPont had stated a cause of action against the photographers; affirming, the Fifth Circuit harumphed that: "To require DuPont to put a roof over the unfinished plant to guard its secret would impose an enormous expense to prevent nothing more than a school boy's trick." <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12322687542949698235">E.

Hrdy, <a href="https://lira.bc.edu/work/ns/4e254769-93a3-42ca-b051-5bdc08155935">The General Knowledge, Skill, and Experience Paradox</a>, 60 B.C. L. Rev. 2409, 2409 (2019). </cite>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> If you're a Recipient, this general-knowledge exclusion might <i>sound</i> good — but it could be troublesome later. Often, it might be hard to determine, <i>on the particular facts</i>, whether the safe harbor applied.

EXAMPLE: A company sued a former employee for misappropriation of the company's trade-secret information; the former employee tried, but failed, to persuade the court that he had merely used his general knowledge and skills, as opposed to misappropriating his former employer's trade-secret information. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7293584813409217313">Brightview Group, LP v.

A number of courts have held that "secret sauce" selections and combinations of <i>non-secret</i> information can be eligible for trade-secret protection. You're doubtless familiar with the concept, e.g., from these well-known examples:
</p>

<p>
&bull;  There's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_formula">formula for making Coca-Cola</a> — although that's been described as largely a marketing strategy: According to a former Pepsi CEO's memoir, supposedly the company's food chemists were readily able to reverse-engineer the formula; Pepsi's then-CEO claimed that it took the company's food chemists only a week to reverse-engineer the Coke formula and produce a drink that was essentially identical to The Real Thing. <cite> See Roger Enrico and Jesse Kornbluth, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Other-Guy-Blinked-Pepsi-Cola/dp/0553051776">The Other Guy Blinked: How Pepsi Won <i>[sic]</i> the Cola Wars</a> (1986). </cite>
</p>

<p>
&bull;  Consider the Kentucky Fried Chicken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC_Original_Recipe">"secret blend" of 11 herbs and spices</a>: That's also perhaps mainly a marketing strategy (supposedly, the key ingredient is white pepper).

<h6 id="org34de78d">Note</h6>

<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: Marking of confidential information is one of the classic ways for a Discloser to <i>show</i> (indirectly) that it took reasonable precautions to protect the information — but quite reasonably, Disclosers prefer not to have marking be a hard-and-fast requirement. ¶ The term "suitably-prominent fashion" would ordinarily mean readily calling attention to the confidential status of the information.</aside>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> <i>Requiring</i> marking of confidential information is not the best idea. To be sure, marking documents as "Confidential" is <b>always</b> a good practice. <b>But</b> when a confidentiality provision <i>requires</i> marking — even with <a href="#conf-info-mk-catch">catch-up marking allowed</a> — it might undesirably <a href="#bar-clear">raise the bar</a> for the Discloser, possibly with significant ill effect: If for some reason a particular Discloser document <i>wasn't</i> marked, then a court might well summarily reject the Discloser's claim of confidentiality. EXAMPLE: This happened in a case involving software giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP">SAP</a>, as well as in a case involving Houston's own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq">Compaq Computer Corp.</a> (which is now part of Hewlett-Packard). <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2677781182986087986">Teradata Corp. v. SAP SE</a>, 570 F. Supp. 3d 810, 826-28 (N.D. Cal 2021) (granting SAP's motion for summary judgment on technical trade secret claim); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6020252752387015139">Convolve, Inc. v. Compaq Computer Corp.</a>, 527 Fed. Appx. 910 No. 2012-1074, slip op. at part II.A.2 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (nonprecedential); see also <a href="https://casetext.com/case/gemisys-corp-v-phoenix-american-inc">Gemisys Corp. v. Phoenix American, Inc.</a>, 186 F.R.D. 551, 558-60 (N.D. Cal. 1999). </cite>
</p>

<p>
That's why here we set up <i>presumptions</i> to encourage the Discloser to mark its Confidential Information — but we don't make marking an absolute requirement, so long as the information in question bears other indicia of confidentiality.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> The Discloser shouldn't go overboard in marking <i>non</i>-confidential information, because that could backfire: If the Discloser were to go crazy with a CONFIDENTIAL stamp and mark obviously-nonconfidential information as confidential, that could hurt the company's credibility in claiming that <i>other</i>, marked information <i>was</i> confidential. 
</p>

<p>
And worse: Marking <i>nonconfidential</i> information as confidential — and then suing for misappropriation of the alleged trade secrets — could lead to a finding of bad-faith litigation. <cite> See Jesse M. Coleman and Kevin Green, <a href="https://www.tradesecretslaw.com/2023/07/articles/trade-secrets/not-all-documents-labeled-confidential-actually-are-texas-jury-finds-23m-trade-secret-case-was-brought-in-bad-faith/">Not All Documents Labeled Confidential Actually Are: Texas Jury Finds $23M Trade Secret Case Was Brought in Bad Faith</a> (Seyfarth.com 2023), <i>discussing</i> Teligistics Inc. v. Advanced Personal Computing Inc., No. 2019-15000, 190th District Court of Harris County, Texas. </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Another benefit of marking: According to two courts, confidentiality markings, standing alone, are likely to be enough — <i>at least at the pleading stage</i> — to support the Discloser's contention that it took reasonable steps to maintain secrecy. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16616010086347381693">Samuel Sherbrooke Corporate, Ltd v. Mayer</a>, No. 24-2173, part III.A, slip op. at 9 (4th Cir.

C.&nbsp; Subdivision 2 supports using this Protocol in a larger agreement in which confidentiality provisions are only a part, not the main point. 
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> In some circumstances, the Recipient might want to negotiate for "have-used" rights (see <a href="#nl-have-used-cmt">28.21</a>), that is, the right to allow specified third parties (e.g., contractors) to use Confidential Information for the Recipient's benefit.

A.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: In case the Discloser additionally wants to <i>require</i> the Recipient to enter into written agreements even with Recipient employees, etc., see the optional language for that purpose at Option <a href="#conf-info-wrtn-k-opt">11.3.32.6</a>.
</p>

<p>
But Entering into a written confidentiality agreement with <i>employees</i>, etc., might not be necessary. That's because (at least in the U.S.) the Recipient's employees, officers, and directors would normally be legally bound to preserve the Recipient's confidential information — and thus, by implication, <i>the Discloser's</i> Confidential Information — even without a written confidentiality agreement.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the Recipient's failing to blow the whistle on one's own <i>potential</i> "issues" with Confidential Information — or those of a Recipient contractor — would technically be a breach of contract by the Recipient;</li>

<li>if it turned out that there wasn't <i>actually</i> a problem, then the Discloser's damages for the Recipient's technical breach would presumably be nil or nominal, <i>but</i></li>

<li>the Recipient's technical breach still might trigger a prevailing-party attorney-fee clause (see <a href="#r-atty-fees">23.2</a>),</li>

<li>and <i>that</i> in turn could force the Recipient to pay the Discloser's perhaps-exorbitant legal expenses — even though the Discloser had suffered no real-world harm.

A.&nbsp; This Option is sometimes proposed by Disclosers, but it will often be overkill when it comes to the Recipient's employees, members of Recipient's board of directors, and others associated with Recipient who are required to maintain confidentiality as a matter of law. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14394415415481933386">Adnet v.

A.&nbsp; Subdivision 2 follows the maxim that you get what you INspect, not what you EXpect (see <a href="#r-inspections-clause">13.4</a>). <b>Caution:</b> The Recipient might be <i>extremely</i> reluctant to agree to this Option — especially if the Recipient and the Discloser are (or might become) competitors or are somehow associated with competitors — e.g., a vendor Recipient might be concerned that a customer Discloser might pass on the vendor's own confidential information to a competing vendor. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 3 <i>could</i> help assuage possible Recipient concerns that the Discloser might want to use an "inspection" for corporate-espionage purposes — for example, to help a competitor of the Recipient that the Discloser was considering doing business with.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Whether an assignment-consent obligation would work for the Recipient would depend in part on how long the Recipient was expected to possess the Discloser's Confidential Information and how long the Recipient's confidentiality obligations would last — and in a long-term confidentiality agreement, such an obligation could undesirably give the Discloser a strategic veto over the Recipient's business prospects, as discussed at <a href="#assmt-asset-except">17.3.5.1</a>.  
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Moreover: An assignment-consent obligation might not even be necessary except as a "for the avoidance of doubt" provision.

<li>making copies of the Discloser's Confidential Information, and/or</li>

<h6 id="org836ccfd">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org836ccfd">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: In today's modern economy, a Recipient might need "have-used rights," discussed in more detail at <a href="#nl-have-used-cmt">28.21</a>. </aside>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Some confidentiality agreements <i>categorically</i> allow disclosure to the Recipient's (outside) consultants and advisors. But from the Discloser's perspective, it's usually better for such rights to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis — because recipient <i>contractors</i> have been known to misappropriate discloser information in developing a competitor to the discloser's product line. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14536845116954817353">Computer Sciences Corp. v. Tata Consultancy Servs. Ltd.</a>, No. 24-10749, part III.A.1, slip op. at 12-15 (5th Cir.

</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> The Discloser might want to try to negotiate for a provision such as the Option of § <a href="#conf-info-wrtn-k-opt">11.3.32.6</a>, requiring the Recipient to provide the Discloser with copies of its agreements with such suppliers and/or contractors to verify that those agreements include the required confidentiality provisions. Otherwise, the Discloser might find itself unable to sue a supplier or contractor that innocently used Discloser information — this evidently happened in a First Circuit case where an end-customer's insurance carrier found itself unable to recover damages from a supplier's supplier that had suffered a data breach. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7097961790104753888">Axis Ins.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: In entering into an NDA, the Recipient might want some assurance that the Discloser isn't merely blowing smoke about the alleged confidentiality of the information to be disclosed. This Option is modeled on a clause that was relevant in an Eleventh Circuit case: "Silikal represents and warrants that it has not disclosed the formula for 1061 SW resin or sold or distributed 1061 SW resin, directly or indirectly, to anyone other than AcryliCon during the pendency of the Silikal/AcryliCon relationship." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14493733455299808016">AcryliCon USA, LLC v.

<p>
B.&nbsp; To reduce the chances of alarming the Discloser, in this Option the Discloser is asked only to represent the secrecy of its information, as opposed to also warranting it. (For more about the distinction between the two, see <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">18.2</a>.)

A.&nbsp;  <b>Caution:</b> If a Recipient were to include a Discloser's Confidential Information in a public filing (for example, a public company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission), it likely would destroy the Discloser's trade-secret rights in the information.

<h6 id="orgd69909b">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgd69909b">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: Some recipients of confidential information — cough, <i>Microsoft</i> — have been known to demand "residuals rights" of this kind, as discussed in the extended comments below.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Disclosers likely will — and often <i>should</i> — push back or at least ask for carve-outs for particularly-sensitive categories of information, e.g., details of technology; pricing; key personnel; and similar categories. <cite> See generally <a href="https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/sourcingatmorganlewis/2017/10/residuals-clauses-in-ip-agreements-and-ndas">Kapoor & Yaghoubi</a> (MorganLewis.com 2017). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> To say the least, this could be a tricky evidentiary problem — for both sides, as discussed in the note below. </aside>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Subdivision 1 — here's an example of a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/viva/vccp-pre-release-agreement">Microsoft residuals clause</a>: "Each party agrees that the use of information retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’ respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law, and each party agrees to limit what it discloses to the other accordingly."
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Here's another example of residuals language, apparently from some kind of venture-capitalist agreement form, that I must have run across somewhere (I can't remember where and don't have notes):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The Company acknowledges that our and our affiliates' review of Proprietary Information will inevitably enhance our and such affiliates’ knowledge and understanding of the business of the Company in a way that cannot be separated from its other knowledge, and the Company agrees that such knowledge and understanding shall not restrict us or such affiliates in connection with our or their consideration or effectuation of any other investments or our or their serving on the boards of such investments.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
F.&nbsp; Subdivision 2.b — proof problems: Suppose that the Discloser claimed that a Recipient staffer — let's call that person "Rebecca" to keep with the "R" initial — had improperly used Confidential Information, but Rebecca said, <i>goodness gracious, of</i> course <i>I didn't intentionally memorize the information; how could you even suggest such a thing!</i>  This might all come down to whether the trier of fact (the judge or jury) believed Rebecca's testimony — and what kind of evidence could the parties put on concerning that issue. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: That was a central <i>factual</i> issue in a bitter corporate lawsuit: In a hostile takeover bid, <span class="underline">did</span> the prospective acquirer improperly use confidential information about the target, in violation of a previous confidentiality agreement between the parties, or not? Delaware's then-Chancellor Strine concluded that the prospective acquirer had in fact used the confidential information: "Once things are learned and done, it is difficult to unlearn and undo them, especially when the old information is still being circulated." <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7975340924897187579">Martin Marietta Materials, Inc v. Vulcan Materials Co.</a>, 56 A.3d 1072, 1098 (Del. Ch.) (Strine, C.), <i>aff'd</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5070167673002100431">68 A.3d 1208</a> (Del. 2012) (en banc). </cite>
</p>

<p>
In our above hypothetical, "Robin" might be able to <i>demonstrate</i> unaided retention by reciting or summarizing the information orally, without notes or prompting. The Discloser might be able to refute that testimony could be refuted if someone else personally saw Robin studying the information and committing it to memory.
</p>

G.&nbsp; Subdivision 3 — <b>caution:</b> A broad scope of residuals rights could complicate trade-secret litigation. This seems to have happened in a case involving Google, which was a principal target of claims that the company's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loon_LLC">Project Loon</a>" — experimenting with providing wireless Internet service using high-altitude balloons orbiting the Earth — had allegedly misappropriated the trade secrets of another company, Space Data. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3703801643109795032">Space Data Corp. v. X</a>, No. 16-cv-03260-BLF (N.D. Cal. Jul. 14, 2017): The case reportedly was settled just before trial; see <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1183150">Albarazi</a> (2019) (paywalled). </cite>

<p>
For a narrow-interpretation approach similar to that of subdivision 3, see section 11.5 on page 44 of <a href="https://www.atlantaga.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/52126/637641099685270000#page=44">this Delta Airlines request for proposal</a>, also <a href="https://www.redline.net/queries/what-s-deal-residuals-rights-clauses-now-routinely-included-big-tech-general-ndas-0#29388-posts">posted</a> at the lawyer-only site redline.net. Here's the residuals-interpretation clause:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
11.5   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Designer shall have the right to retain, use and disclose, without accounting to Owner, any of Designer’s Residual Knowledge. 
</p>

<p>
"Residual Knowledge" shall mean and include information not specifically generated for this Project, such as design details, and the type that Applicable Law would permit an employee of Designer to retain and use in subsequent employment with a third party. 
</p>

<p>
This exception to the obligations of confidentiality and non-use shall be <b>narrowly construed</b>, is intended only to <b>alleviate the possibility of inadvertent breach</b> of this Agreement arising from routine, unaided memory retention by employees of Designer and is not intended to permit Designer to use or disclose information known to Designer to be Work Product or Confidential Information subject to this Agreement.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ts-defn">
<p>
A.&nbsp; In the U.S., a "trade secret" is particular confidential information that derives <i>independent economic value from secrecy</i>; this is provided in both:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>federal law: the Defend Trade Secrets Act, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1839">18 U.S.C. § 1839(3)</a> and the Economic Espionage Act, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1831">18 U.S.C. § 1831</a>; and</li>

<li>state law: in most states, a variation on the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/trade_secret">Uniform Trade Secrets Act</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
B.&nbsp; In court, the Discloser would likely have to <i>prove</i> the economic value of its alleged trade secrets, <i>and</i> that the value came from the secrecy of the information in question. EXAMPLE: In one case, the Fourth Circuit held that "part of [the plaintiff's] obligation was to come forward with evidence that its seventy-five alleged trade secrets had value <i>because they remain secret</i>. Proof of value untethered to value derived from secrecy does not show an alleged trade secret’s independent economic value." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=310216696779849763">Synopsys, Inc. v. Risk Based Security, Inc.</a>, 70 F. 4th 759, 772 (4th Cir. 2023) (affirming summary judgment in favor of defendant Synopsys) (emphasis in original). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; In the U.S., various statutory remedies are available to possessors of "trade secrets" under the laws cited just above. 
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Drafters should keep in mind that "Confidential Information" can encompass more than just "trade secrets" that provide economic advantage. EXAMPLE: The Northern District of California noted that "a defendant may breach a contract for disclosing confidential information that does not constitute a trade secret." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3956435087526566694">Albert's Organics, Inc. v. Holzman</a>, 445 F. Supp. 3d 463, 476 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (denying, in part, defendant's motion to dismiss). </cite>
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Here's an edge case: If information has <i>no</i> economic value <i>unless</i> it becomes public, then the information can't be a trade secret — so held the court in a case where a company tried unsuccessfully to claim trade-secret protection for a contractual addendum (or "rider") that could be added to a standard annuity agreement to provide enhanced wealth-transfer benefits to the purchaser of the annuity. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12754048327932597098">Novus Group, LLC v. Prudential Financial Inc.</a>, 618 F. Supp. 3d 657, 666-67 (D. Ohio 2022) (granting Prudential's motion for summary judgment on Novus Group's trade-secret claim), <i>affirmed on other grounds,</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13024980649577335776">74 F.4th 424</a> (6th Cir. 2023). The <i>Novus</i> case was decided under Ohio's version of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, whose <a href="https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-1333.61">definition of "trade secret"</a> is substantially the same as that of the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act. </cite>
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; Tangentially: Two leading IP scholars have argued that "[a] company can 'abandon' its trade secrets <i>by failing to derive economic value</i> from keeping them secret"; in such a case, conceivably information could lose its trade-secret status but still remain Confidential Information. <cite> See Camilla A. Hrdy & Mark A. Lemley, <a href="https://review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Hrdy-Lemley-73-Stan.-L.-Rev.-1.pdf">Abandoning Trade Secrets</a>, 73 Stanford L.

<div id="outline-container-nda-neg-know" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="nda-neg-know"><span class="section-number-5">11.3.34.2.</span> Negative know-how can qualify</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nda-neg-know">
<p>
Negative know-how can be Confidential Information. The concept was pithily summarized up by legendary inventor Thomas Edison, who is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/3091287.Thomas_A_Edison">widely quoted</a> as having said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." That kind of knowledge could have economic value and thus could be a trade secret if maintained in confidence.
</p>

<p>
<b>But:</b> Negative know-how is one of those areas where proof of secrecy and value of the negative know-how itself will be especially important. EXAMPLE: A federal district court in New York City observed (arguably in a nonbinding dictum) that "[i]t is difficult to see how <i>negative</i> trade secrets consisting of unsuccessful efforts to develop trade secrets and experimental dead ends can have independent economic value when <i>the end result</i> of the process, the <i>positive</i> trade secrets, have in fact been uncovered." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16016385114749780551">Zirvi v. Flatley</a>, 433 F.

<h5 id="conf-info-pty"><span class="section-number-5">11.3.34.3.</span> Caution: <span class="underline">Always</span> ask for a <span class="underline">two</span>-way NDA</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-conf-info-pty">
<p>
Let's return to our course hypothetical where small-company MathWhiz is trying to get a consulting contract from a potential customer, Gigunda: As a big company, Gigunda might want MathWhiz to sign a "one-way" NDA that protects only <i>Gigunda's</i> information. That way, Gigunda wouldn't have to worry about keeping <i>MathWhiz's</i> information confidential. <b>Question:</b> Can the NDA accommodate Gigunda's wish, while still providing at least some protection for MathWhiz? The above language offers one possibility.
</p>

<p>
In the real world, the NDA likely would indicate which party's or parties' information would be protected. And the NDA might explicitly indicate that <i>MathWhiz's</i> confidential information <i>won't</i> be made available to Gigunda. This could be because MathWhiz wants to be clear that it won't be disclosing its trade secrets to Gigunda (at least not before a deal is signed). But it could also be that Gigunda wants to be clear that Gigunda is not agreeing to be bound by confidentiality obligations for whatever information MathWhiz <i>does</i> provide. 
</p>

<p>
(<b>Caution:</b> By law, each party might still have other confidentiality obligations for information provided by the other party, for example under laws protecting the privacy of personal information or under export-control laws. See the discussions at Protocol <a href="#r-priv-law-defn">11.6</a> (privacy) and <a href="#nl-export-ctrls">28.11</a> (export controls).)
</p>

<p>
BUT: Even if MathWhiz and Gigunda originally intended for only Gigunda to disclose its confidential information to MathWhiz, their NDA should preferably still be <i>two</i>-way, not one-way. Here's why: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Later, the parties' <i>business people</i> might decide it'd be good for MathWhiz to reveal certain of its own confidential information to Gigunda.</li>

<li>And those business people — <i>without checking with "the lawyers"</i> — might well assume, wrongly, that "we have an NDA in place so sure, let's do it."</li>
</ul>

<p>
But that's <i>not</i> OK — at least not from MathWhiz's point of view: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The existing, one-way NDA was drafted to protect <i>only Gigunda's</i> information, not MathWhiz's.</li>

<li>That, in turn, means that <i>Gigunda has no confidentiality obligations</i> with respect to MathWhiz's information.</li>

<li>And so, MathWhiz's <i>unprotected</i> provision of trade secrets to Gigunda <i>will likely destroy MathWhiz's legal rights in those trade secrets</i>. EXAMPLE: Something close to that actually happened to a recipient in a Seventh Circuit case. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3855750888701636738">Fail-Safe, LLC v. A.O. Smith Corp.</a>, 674 F.3d 889, 893-94 (7th Cir. 2012) (affirming summary judgment for defendant). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
To accommodate the above concern, this § <a href="#conf-info-rcpt">11.3.1</a> allows for MathWhiz and Gigunda to use a <i>one-way</i> NDA, <i>initially</i> protecting only Gigunda's information, to also protect MathWhiz's information.  This provides flexibility for the parties: Assuming that Gigunda did agree to confidentiality obligations for MathWhiz's information, it'd be easy for MathWhiz to get Gigunda to indicate that agreement in writing, e.g., in an email.
</p>

<p>
And also later, if all else failed, MathWhiz could try to show that <i>the circumstances</i> indicated that Gigunda did in fact consent to receiving MathWhiz's information in confidence; here are two possibilities:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The parties' emails, while not explicitly saying, "Gigunda agrees," might still clearly indicate that Gigunda gave such consent;</li>

<li>Mary Marvel (MathWhiz's CEO) could email someone in authority at Gigunda to confirm an <i>oral</i> agreement that the NDA would apply to MathWhiz's information, with Gigunda not timely objecting and acting consistently with such an agreement; or</li>

<li>Gigunda's oral agreement might be confirmed by some disinterested third party (which seems unlikely).</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-nda-two-bal" class="outline-5 cmtry">
<h5 id="nda-two-bal"><span class="section-number-5">11.3.34.4.</span> Two-way NDA terms are usually more balanced — but not always</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nda-two-bal">
<p>
<i>Other things being equal</i>, a supposedly "two-way" agreement, one that applies equally when either party plays a particular role — here, MathWhiz and Gigunda as Disclosers and Recipients — is <i>likely</i> (but not guaranteed) to be more balanced.
</p>

<p>
<b>But</b>:  An agreement that's <i>nominally</i> two-way can still be biased in favor of the drafting party. Example: Suppose that Gigunda's lawyer (i) is doing the drafting, and (ii) knows that Gigunda will be getting access to MathWhiz's confidential information but not the other way around. In that situation:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Recipient Gigunda's lawyer might write a <i>nominally</i> two-way confidentiality provision that in fact provides very little protection for discloser MathWhiz's information, because Gigunda's lawyer wants to "win the negotiation" for Gigunda. <i>(This desire to "win" is an occupational hazard for lawyers.)</i>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  As a result, <i>MathWhiz's</i> lawyer would have to review the confidentiality provisions carefully to make sure it contained sufficient protection for MathWhiz's information.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, if it's discloser <i>MathWhiz's</i> lawyer who's doing the drafting, then the confidentiality provisions might contain requirements that recipient <i>Gigunda's</i> lawyer would have to review carefully to be sure that the provisions wouldn't impose too much of a burden on Gigunda.

<p>
Some drafters <i>(your author isn't one of them)</i> also like to include a long "laundry list" of specific categories information that can qualify as confidential information. But:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's arguably little need — or none at all — for such a list, given the breadth of the definition of Confidential Information in this Protocol.</li>

<li>Including such a list marginally increases the reader's "cognitive burden" (a fancy name for workload) and thus can slow up the contract-negotiation process.</li>

<li>From the Discloser's perspective: You wouldn't want the Recipient to try to claim that particular information <i>wasn't</i> in one of the listed categories, and so (the Recipient argues) the information supposedly doesn't qualify as Confidential Information, notwithstanding the "not of limitation" language.</li>
</ul>

DCT note: I'm editing this section in February 2025, when it remains to be seen what changes will be needed as a result of the second Trump adminstration's sidelining of the NLRB by <a href="https://www.kelleydrye.com/viewpoints/blogs/labor-days/nlrb-leadership-in-flux-chair-gwynne-wilcoxs-unprecedented-firing-a-quorum-less-board-and-implications-for-employers">firing its chair, other Democratic-appointed member, and general counsel</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> In employment-related agreements, the (U.S.) <b>National Labor Relations Board</b> (NLRB or "Board") has been known to be hostile to NDA-type provisions that could be interpreted as insufficiently explaining <i>to employees</i> their right to engage in concerted action under the National Labor Relations Act, as seen in a 2019 Advice Memorandum from the Board's general counsel, concerning a non-disparagement clause in a law firm's employment agreement. <cite> See Advice Memorandum dated Nov. 13, 2019, in <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/14-CA-227644">Case No. 14-CA-227644</a>, discussed in <a href="https://www.dickinsonlaw.com/blogs-articles/2019/11/25/non-disparagement-clauses-in-cross-hairs-of-nlrb--lessons-for-employers--their-employment-lawyers">this law firm memo</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Likewise, the Board has traditionally been hostile to contractual confidentiality restrictions that purport to limit employees' discussions of wages and working conditions. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8295501719978973216">Nat'l Labor Rel. Bd. v. Long Island Assoc. for AIDS Care</a>, 870 F.3d 82, 88-89 (2d Cir. 2017) (affirming Board ruling). </cite>
</p>

<p>
An undated Board Web page — still on the site at this writing — states:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or the Act), employees have the right to communicate with their coworkers about their wages, as well as with labor organizations, worker centers, the media, and the public. Wages are a vital term and condition of employment, and discussions of wages are often preliminary to organizing or other actions for mutual aid or protection. <cite> Office of General Counsel, National Labor Relations Board, <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages">Your Right to Discuss Wages</a> (NLRB.gov, undated). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
And in recent years with Democratic majorities on the NLRB, the Board has taken the position that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[under] the Board’s recent decision in <i>McLaren Macomb</i>, &#x2026; the Board returned to longstanding precedent holding that <b>employers violate</b> the National Labor Relations Act when they <b>offer</b> employees severance agreements that <b>require employees to broadly waive their rights</b> under the Act. &#x2026; [S]everance agreement provisions that could violate the Act if proffered, maintained, or enforced, includ[e] confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-disparagement, among others. <cite> Office of Public Affairs, National Labor Relations Board, <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-general-counsel-issues-memo-with-guidance-to-regions-on-severance">NLRB General Counsel Issues Memo with Guidance to Regions on Severance Agreements</a> (NLRB.gov March 22, 2023) (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
At least before the second Trump administration came into office, the <b>Federal Trade Commission's</b> antitrust lawyers weren't letting the NLRB have all the fun: In a 2023 announcement, the FTC's Bureau of Competition warned that it regarded confidentiality agreements <i>and employer-notification requirements</i> as "imped[ing] Bureau investigations" and so "are contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable." The announcement explained:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Although exact terms vary, the following general types of contract provisions can impede Bureau investigations: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>confidentiality agreements,</li>
<li>nondisclosure agreements, and</li>
<li>notice-of-agency-contact provisions. &#x2026;</li>
</ul>
<p>
The exact terms and conditions may vary, but these restrictions and requirements can all have the same chilling effect on individuals’ willingness to speak voluntarily with Bureau staff. That chilling effect impedes the Federal Trade Commission’s ability to carry out its statutory mandate. <cite> Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Competition, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Formal-Analysis.pdf">Contracts That Impede Bureau of Competition Investigations</a> 1, 2 (FTC.gov June 15, 2023) (extra paragraphing and bullets added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
Restrictions on corporate whistleblowers could attract unwanted attention from the <b>Securities and Exchange Commission</b>: In 2024, the SEC announced that it had settled big-dollar civil claims against Wall Street firms J.P. Morgan, D.E. Shaw, and others (but probably couch change to some of the settling defendants) for entering into agreements that restricted whistleblower claims. <cite> See SEC press release 2024-7, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-7">J.P. Morgan to Pay $18 Million for Violating Whistleblower Protection Rule</a> (SEC.gov 2024); SEC press release 2023-213, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-213">SEC Charges D. E. Shaw with Violating Whistleblower Protection Rule</a> (SEC.gov 2023); see also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-118">SEC press release 2024-118</a> (various public companies agree to pay a total of more than $3 million in civil penalties); Amanda Brown and Heather Raun, <a href="https://www.employmentlawwatch.com/2023/10/articles/us-alert/sec-implements-new-level-of-scrutiny-for-employment-agreements-and-separation-agreements-under-whistleblower-protection-rule/">SEC implements new level of scrutiny for employment agreements and separation agreements under whistleblower protection rule</a> (EmploymentLawWatch.com 2023). </cite>
</p>

<p>
It might not be enough for a contract  to include a disclaimer: In 2023, the SEC also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2023/34-98322.pdf">announced</a> that it had settled civil charges against Monolith Resources, LLC for using a form of separation that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; stated that "nothing in this agreement is intended to limit in any way your right or ability to file a charge or claim with any federal, state, or local agency," <b>but</b> the agreement also took away an employee’s right to recover a monetary award for filing a claim with, or participating in an investigation or action by, a governmental agency.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Emphasis added.) Without admitting liability, Monolith consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay a civil penalty of $225,000.

<h5 id="ConfInfoNoNDAMaybe"><span class="section-number-5">11.3.35.4.</span> Pro tip:  <i>Asking</i> for an NDA might scare a recipient</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ConfInfoNoNDAMaybe">
<p>
Depending on the circumstances, the <i>business</i> benefit of asking another party for an NDA might be outweighed by the risk that the other party might be scared off by the request, out of concern that the NDA would give the first party a weapon with which to sue the other party — triggering the expense and burden of litigation and the risk of making a bad impression on a jury — if the relationship were to go south. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Celeritas</i> (Fed. Cir. 1998), a federal-court jury in Los Angeles awarded a one-man startup company more than $117 million (in 2025 dollars) against aerospace conglomerate Rockwell International for breaching a confidentiality agreement. The parties had entered into the NDA to discuss a possible royalty-bearing license for data-compression technology for which the man had filed a patent application. Rockwell's position was that the man's innovation consisted of well-known engineering techniques and so royalty payments weren't warranted. The jury didn't buy it; on appeal, the Federal Circuit ruled that the man's patent was indeed invalid in view of the prior art, but the court declined to overturn the jury's finding that Rockwell had breached the NDA. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16810614390244449913">Celeritas Technologies Ltd. v. Rockwell Int'l, Inc.</a>, 150 F.3d 1354, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Disclosure: I was part of Rockwell's trial team in that case.. </cite>
</p>

<p>
This illustrates why big companies are often highly-reluctant to sign NDAs, especially with startups or other smaller companies.
</p>

<p>
So in terms of "deal psychology," a prospective Discloser's best bet might be to hold off on asking the prospective Recipient sign an NDA, and instead — for the time being — to provide the Recipient only with information that wouldn't seriously harm Discloser if it were to become public or get into the hands of a competitor. That would allow the parties to defer negotiating an NDA until the Recipient had become more comfortable with the idea, and with the Discloser.

<h5 id="ConfInfoNDAInvestors"><span class="section-number-5">11.3.35.5.</span> Special case: Disclosure to venture capitalists, etc.</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ConfInfoNDAInvestors">
<p>
Amplifying the discussion in <a href="#ConfInfoNoNDAMaybe">11.3.35.4</a>: Potential investors in a company might be reluctant to sign a nondisclosure agreement ("NDA").  In particular, venture capitalists ("VCs") often flatly refuse to sign NDAs with prospective portfolio companies, because they don't want to risk saying "no" to a company about investing, only to be sued years later for allegedly disclosing the company's technology to someone else. 
</p>

<p>
Of course, it's not as if recipients never, ever acquire confidential information under an NDA and then use the information anyway. Amazon's venture-capital arm supposedly did that to small tech companies DefinedCrowd, LivingSocial, and others, according to press reports. <cite> See Dana Mattioli and Cara Lombardo, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249?mod=e2twd">Amazon Met With Startups About Investing, Then Launched Competing Products</a> (WSJ.com Jul. 23, 2020). </cite>
</p>

<p>
But even so: As a practical matter, going without an NDA <i>with non-corporate venture capitalists</i> might not be a bad bet, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can try to be very, very selective about what you disclose without an NDA, so that you're not giving away the "secret sauce" (see § <a href="#ConfInfoSauce">11.3.14</a>) of your idea.</li>

<li>Individual "angel" investors and others generally do have one or two other things on their minds. They generally see lots of entrepreneurs who are convinced they've got a world-beating "unicorn" idea. You'll probably be lucky to get these investors to pay attention for two minutes. Ask yourself how likely it is that they'll want to take your idea and spend time and money building a business without you.</li>

<li>Contracts aren't the only thing that discourage bad behavior. If an investor stole someone's idea, and if word got around, then that investor might later find it hard to get other people to talk to him.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You have to decide what risks you want to take. Your business might fail because an investor steals your idea and beats you to market. Or it might fail because you can't raise the money you need to get started. 
</p>

<p>
By analogy: It's sort of like having to take a trip across the country, and you have to decide whether to fly or drive:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you flew, there's a risk you could die in a plane crash flying from one side of the country to the other, and you'd be contributing to greenhouse gases. <cite> See, e.g., Mark Miodownik, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/opinion/air-travel-airlines-carbon-capture-climate-change.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mU4.nLzs.dylFRAlyWak9&smid=url-share">I Won’t Feel Good About Flying Until the Airlines Solve This</a> (NYTimes.com 2024). </cite></li>

<li>But if you were to drive the same route, your risk of dying in a car crash has been estimated as being something like 65 times greater than if you flew — and you'd still be contributing at least somewhat to greenhouse gases, possibly even more so than flying. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-49349566">Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train?</a> (BBC.com 2019). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
As the old saying goes, you pays your money and you takes your choice.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-conf-info-rcp-choo">
<p>
When dealing with other parties in contract situations, you'd be well-advised to be choosy about <i>accepting</i> the other party's confidential information — and to consider using "protection" in the form of a confidentiality agreement that includes appropriate exclusions such as those in Protocol <a href="#r-conf-info-proto">11.3</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> It can be dangerous to acquire confidential information of a competitor, for example in merger negotiations, even under a confidentiality agreement ("NDA"). That's because if a deal <i>doesn't</i> come to pass, the "owner" of the confidential information might later claim that the recipient made improper use of the target company's confidential information. Something like this happened in a 2021 Ninth Circuit case in which Facebook was caught in the middle. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3494441462132744599">BladeRoom Grp.

A prospective Recipient might want to ask the Discloser to enter into a <i>nonconfidentiality</i> agreement that states explicitly that the <i>Recipient has no confidentiality obligations</i> concerning the Discloser's information.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-conf-info-publ-nc">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Publication — of which <b>patenting</b> is one form — is one way in which allegedly-confidential information can be conclusively disqualified from confidentiality status. As the SDNY noted: "It is axiomatic that a plaintiff cannot recover for the misappropriation of a trade secret if he revealed that secret in a published patent or patent application." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6214960575815942331">Broker Genius, Inc. v.

<p>
B.&nbsp; Likewise, when computer-program source code is part of a U.S. <b>copyright registration</b> filing, the code (generally) is publicly available from the Copyright Office and so cannot be a trade secret. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8207454350930432879">Capricorn Mgmt.

<p>
EXAMPLE: A Taiwanese machine-tools manufacturer sued its former U.S. distributor for allegedly misappropriating the manufacturer's trade secrets. The manufacturer, as part of its legal strategy, registered more than 20 technical drawings with the U.S. Copyright Office — without redacting (blacking out) any parts of the drawings. The court had no difficulty concluding that by doing so, the manufacturer had "extinguished" any trade-secret rights it had in the content of the drawings. <cite> See <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/24-1675/24-1675-2025-07-09.pdf">Sysco Machinery Corp. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-conf-info-excl-asc-a">
<p>
A.&nbsp; It can be challenging — read: costly — to litigate the fact-specific question whether particular information does or doesn't qualify as "readily ascertainable." Here are some cases in which parties had to (expensively) litigate whether particular allegedly-trade-secret information was "readily ascertainable" and therefore ineligible for legal protection:
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A federal appeals court threw out a $22 million jury verdict against cosmetics giant L'Oréal for "willful or malicious" misappropriation of an alleged trade secret (involving the use of maleic acid during bleaching) because the purported trade secret wasn't eligible to be treated as such, as the information was "readily ascertainable by proper means" in a number of previously-issued patents and published patent applications. <cite> See <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/20-1382.OPINION.5-6-2021_1774068.pdf">Olaplex, Inc. v.

May 6, 2021) (reversing denial of judgment as a matter of law as to trade-secret misappropriation) (non-precedential). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A New York appeals court held that "to the extent the features identified by plaintiffs were readily ascertainable from the publicly-available Rendezvoo website, they are not protectable trade secrets." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9477020163175365044">Schroeder v.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A federal appeals court ruled that, under Texas law, a discloser's information lost its trade-secret status because the information had <i>become</i> readily ascertainable through reverse engineering of the discloser's publicly-released; this was true even though the receipient had not itself reverse-engineered the product. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3358739901067764223">ams-OSRAM USA Inc. v.

(Hat tip: <a href="https://www.redline.net/queries/public-knowledge-exception-confidentiality#30662-posts">Cynthia Abesa</a>.) </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> A jury didn't buy a defendant's argument that particular alleged trade secrets were "public or general knowledge in the industry." <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1395505190976857469">Harbor Business Compliance Corp v. Firstbase IO Inc.</a>, 152 F.4th 516, 530-31 (3d Cir. 2025).</cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>"Improper means"?</b>  The federal Defend Trade Secrets Act gives examples of <i>improper</i> means (at <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1839">18 U.S.C. § 1839(6)</a>, concerning "readily ascertainable") as "(A) includ[ing] theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, or espionage through electronic or other means; and (B) does not include reverse engineering, independent derivation, or any other lawful means of acquisition[.]" 
</p>

<p>
For a head-scratching outlier example of what one court said was <i>improper</i> means, see <a href="#org8950ca8">the discussion</a> at <a href="#ConfInfoExclFreely-a">Note</a> of the Fifth Circuit's <i>Christopher</i> case, where the court affirmed a ruling that DuPont could sue photographers who'd been hired, by an unknown party, to overfly — in public, unrestricted airspace — and photograph a chemical-plan site that was under construction site.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Probably to the regret of businesses, the Act doesn't seem to provide any "<a href="#safe-harbor">safe harbors</a>" for <i>proper</i> means. But the U.S. Supreme Court commented, in the (IP-)famous 1974 <i>Kewanee Oil</i> case, that "a trade secret law &#x2026; does not offer protection against discovery by fair and honest means, <i>such as by</i> independent invention, accidental disclosure, or by so-called reverse engineering &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7210506171880070328">Kewanee Oil Co. v.

Under subdivision (6)(B) of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1839">18 U.S.C. § 1839</a>, "breach &#x2026; of a duty to maintain secrecy" is one form of "improper means" of ascertaining a trade secret — but the answer under <i>state</i> law might be different (or might not be), as addressed in several court cases.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A Texas appellate court held that under Texas law, "[a] <i>post-acquisition</i> breach of a confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement &#x2026; cannot support an improper means finding as a matter of law." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13222991505647273295">Title Source, Inc. v.

When a Recipient gets sued for misappropriating Confidential Information, one standard Recipient defense is to claim, "Oh, well, we already knew <i>that</i> information!" or "Well, yeah, we learned that from the Discloser, but we developed our own version!" Juries can be skeptical of such claims, to the point of rejecting them altogether.

<p>
EXAMPLE: A company (the "customer") engaged another company (the "vendor") to produce "white label" business-compliance software for the customer to use with its own customers. Disputes arose about the scope of the project; eventually the customer ditched the vendor and soon came out with its own software. Unhappy with events, the vendor sued the customer for misappropriation of the vendor's trade secrets; the customer responded that it had developed the information itself, but the jury didn't buy it, awarding the developer some $25 million in damages. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1395505190976857469">Harbor Business Compliance Corp v. Firstbase IO Inc.</a>, 152 F.4th 516 (3d Cir. 2025).

<p>
<b>Lesson:</b> Recipients of allegedly-confidential information should plan to document independent possession of the information:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>by preserving documentary evidence of having <i>received</i> the information from another source; and</li>

<li>by using "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design">clean room</a>" techniques to document independent <i>development</i> of the information.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To help prove prior knowledge of information, the Recipient should <i>consider</i> notifying the Discloser — promptly and in writing — if the Discloser provides the Recipient with information that the Recipient already knew. (This might be overly burdensome on the business, though.)
</p>

<b>But:</b> The Recipient probably should push back against any request by the Discloser to make such notification a contractual <i>requirement</i>.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nda-empl-no">
<p>
In some cases, a Discloser might try to demand that each Recipient <i>employee</i>, etc., must <i>personally</i> sign an individual confidentiality agreement with the Discloser (see the optional clause language at Protocol) — thus exposing the employee to <i>personally</i> being sued by the Discloser merely for doing his- or her job. 
</p>

<p>
(If a Recipient's counsel rejects such a Discloser demand, at least for routine matters the Discloser often won't push the point.)
</p>

<p>
Why might this be important? Because:
</p>

<p>
1.  Lawsuit plaintiffs will sometimes sue defendants' <i>employees</i> individually, perhaps to try to muscle the employees into cooperating against their employers, e.g., in discovery matters.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The State of Oregon once sued Oracle over alleged problems in implementing the state's Obamacare exchange system; the state sued not just Oracle itself, but also various Oracle employees personally — including a demand that an Oracle technical manager personally pay the state $45 million (!).(<a href="#r-empl-non-recourse">3.5</a>)
</p>

<p>
2.  The Recipient likely will not want its employees to feel conflicted about their obligations to <i>the Recipient</i>, versus their personal exposure to possible liability from a lawsuit by the Discloser.

<p>
EXAMPLE: A UK lawyer signed a confidentiality agreement relating to a group of law firms' representation of plaintiffs in the Volkswagen "Dieselgate" engine emissions matter. The NDA included what amounted to a noncompetition covenant (concerning which, see generally <a href="#r-noncompete-cls">24.5</a>), which barred the lawyer's firm from representing <i>other</i> plaintiffs in the matter for six years. The UK Supreme Court affirmed enforcement of the noncompete. <cite> See <a href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2021/32.html">Harcus Sinclair LLP v. Your Lawyers Ltd.</a> [2021] UKSC 32. </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> In the U.S., such a lawyer- and law-firm noncompetition covenant might well be unenforceable as violating the <i>clients'</i> right to choose their counsel. See American Bar Association, <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_6_restrictions_on_rights_to_practice/">Model Rules of Professional Conduct 5.6</a>: "A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making: (a) a partnership, shareholders, operating, employment, or other similar type of agreement that restricts the right of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement &#x2026;."
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A California appeals court ruled that a confidentiality clause in an employment agreement was so broad as to amount to a noncompetition clause (concerning which, see <a href="#r-noncompete-cls">24.5</a>) and therefore was unenforceable. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6337705762592340916">Brown v.

A.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: This section follows the <b>R.O.O.M. Principle</b>: Root Out Opportunities for Mistakes (or, Misunderstandings). Without an upon-request feature, the Possessor's busy people could easily forget (or never be aware in the first place) that the Possessor was contractually obligated to purge information. This could harm not just the possessor but the owner as well:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the possessor were to forget to comply with the return-or-destruction obligations, then the owner might use that fact to bash the possessor as a scofflaw in front of a judge or jury — this seems to have been a factor in the Federal Circuit's 2020 <i>SiOnyx</i> decision.<sup><a id="fnr.21" class="footref" href="#fn.21" role="doc-backlink">21</a></sup></li>

<li>On the other hand, suppose that the <i>owner</i> were to fail to follow up to confirm the possessor's return or destruction of the information (e.g., by failing to ask for a certificate of return or destruction). A third party, learning about that failure, might try to use the owner's failure to support an argument that the owner had failed to take reasonable precautions to preserve the secrecy of its information — and thus that the information had lost its confidentiality status.</li>

B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: Prerequisites for Purging might include, for example, achievement of certain milestones in the parties' transaction or relationship.

A.&nbsp; In many situations, a blanket obligation to return or destroy documents might not be practical, especially where electronic information is concerned.

Consider, for example, the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_discovery">litigation discovery</a> of electronically-stored information, or "ESI": Anyone who has gone through that process can attest to the burden and expense of even just <i>identifying</i> the information that might need to be returned or destroyed.

A.&nbsp; This Opt-In has several benefits — mainly for the Owner: It makes it easier for the Owner to manage its contract rights; it gives the <i>Possessor</i> an incentive to do a good job in complying with the return-or-destruction requirement; and it helps the parties — <i>before</i> a dispute arises — to identify specific areas that might need attention, and thus possibly help to avoid the dispute in the first place.

<p>
Unless clearly agreed otherwise, "<b>Consumer Price Index</b>" and "<b>CPI</b>" each refer to the All Items Consumer Price Index — All Urban Consumers ("CPI-U"), as published from time to time by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</p>
</div>

<h6 id="orgdc1d2e9">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgdc1d2e9">
<p>
A.&nbsp; <b>Background: The problem of multiple CPIs.</b> Some contracts include inflation-adjustment clauses that lock in agreed pricing levels for a specified time period — but allowing the vendor to increase pricing by no more than X% per year (let's say) <i>or</i> by the corresponding increase in CPI, whichever is greater (or sometimes, whichever is <i>less</i>).
</p>

<p>
The problem is, there are multiple "CPIs"; sometimes, <i>after</i> the contract is signed, the parties could disagree about <i>which</i> CPI should be used. Depending on the purpose of the inflation adjustment, the CPI-U measure might or might not be the best specific index to use; see the commentary below for other possibilities.
</p>

<p>
For convenience and certainty, when a contract just says (for example) "price increases no greater than CPI," this Protocol specifies one of them as the "default" adjustment index.
</p>

<p>
There are also other inflation adjustment indexes such as, for example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/cpiw.html">CPI-W</a>, Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers;</li>

<li><a href="https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=dropmap&series_id=CUUR0300SA0,CUUS0300SA0">Regional CPIs</a>;</li>

<li>other <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/">specialty CPIs</a> for, e.g., airline fares; college tuition; household energy; medical care; motor fuel; used cars and trucks; and others.</li>
</ul>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Which index to use?</b> As explained in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119043006/https://www.bls.gov/cpi/questions-and-answers.htm#Question_15">FAQ page</a> of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (archived version of question 15, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/questions-and-answers.htm">now listed under</a> "Is the CPI the best measure of inflation?"):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Various indexes have been devised to measure different aspects of inflation. Inflation has been defined as a process of continuously rising prices or, equivalently, of a continuously falling value of money.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The CPI measures inflation as experienced by consumers in their day-to-day living expenses;</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-r-price-increase-limit-option">
<p>
When a prospective customer enters into an ongoing master purchase agreement with a vendor, the customer often wants the vendor to agree to limit how much the vendor can increase its pricing. This often requires more than a little negotiation — for example, of <i>customer</i> concessions such as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>committing to a certain level of "spend," possibly per year or per quarter;</li>

<li>maintaining the contract for a certain amount of time; and/or</li>

<li>a fee for early termination, akin to what cell-phone providers often require in return for discounted pricing.</li>

<h6 id="orgb08b695">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgb08b695">
<p>
A.&nbsp; This Option is phrased as requiring an "alert," as opposed to requiring <i>notice</i> (concerning which, see Protocol <a href="#r-notices-rule">2.8</a>).
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; This Option doesn't require the Vendor to alert the Customer about upcoming price <i>decreases</i>. That's because:  
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Customer will generally be happy to have price <i>decreases</i> go into effect immediately, without advance notice and thus without a waiting period.</li>

<li>The Customer's main desire would be for advance notice of a pricing <i>increase</i> for budget-planning purposes, and to let the Customer make purchases before the increase goes into effect.</li>
</ol>

<p>
C.&nbsp; True: The Customer might <i>like</i> to hear about upcoming price <i>decreases</i>. That would allow the Customer to defer non-urgent purchases that it might otherwise have made at the higher price.
</p>

<p>
<b>But</b> the <i>Vendor</i> would likely object to being required to let <i>anyone</i> know in advance about upcoming price <i>decreases</i>, because:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Vendor might not know in advance that it would be cutting prices; and</li>

<li>The Vendor wouldn't want to have to wait out an advance-notice period, because that could hurt the Vendor's ability to make sales at the old, higher pricing — especially if word leaked to other customers. That'd be akin to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect">Osborne Effect</a> that's famous in the tech world for having purportedly destroyed one of the first portable-computer companies in the early 1980s: Osborne prematurely announced a future model, resulting in plummeting sales of the existing model. (The Wikipedia article lists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect#Other_examples">other examples</a> of such vendor experiences.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
In any case, the <i>Customer</i> likely would prefer to have the Vendor's price <i>cuts</i> take effect immediately, to give the Customer maximum budget flexibility. 
</p>

<p>
And finally, the Customer might be satisfied with this Option, requiring advance notice of <i>increases</i>, in lieu of a more-restrictive pricing clause. That might be especially true if the Customer had other options for acquiring the Vendor's goods or services — if the Vendor's price increases were too much for the Customer's tastes, then the Customer could <i>perhaps</i> just take its business elsewhere (assuming switching costs were not a major consideration).

In court, though, the term doesn't have a settled, standard meaning, as discussed <a href="#nl-CREUnclear">below</a>. This Protocol therefore proposes some general guidelines to help determine what's required — and what's not required — of a party that commits to using <i>commercially-reasonable efforts</i>.

Here we follow IBM's lead in defining <i>commercially-reasonable efforts</i> in the way that it did in one of its state-government IT contracts, in <i>Indiana v. IBM</i>. That particular contract (seemingly drafted by IBM) defined <i>commercially reasonable efforts</i> (somewhat circularly) as: "taking commercially reasonable steps <i>[sic]</i> and performing in such a manner as a well managed entity would undertake with respect to a matter in which it was acting in a <i>determined, prudent</i>, businesslike and reasonable manner &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15875629466981342045">Indiana v.

A.&nbsp; This section provides some guardrails against aggressive arguments by litigation counsel.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2 addresses an issue raised in a California federal court, which opined that "it is an absurdity to suggest a reasonable business entity would contractually obligate itself to operate <i>[making commercially-reasonable efforts]</i> without regard to its business interests"; in a later ruling, the court, reviewing (sparse) precedent, held that the obligated party could permissibly take into account "its own economic business interests" in taking action. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15202977054272395445">Citri-Lite Co. v. Cott Beverages, Inc.</a>, 721 F. Supp. 2d 912, 923-26 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (footnote omitted; citing several cases from various jurisdictions); <i>subsequent decision</i>, <a href="https://perma.cc/GX5Y-4VVN">No. 1:07-cv-01075</a>, slip op. at 45 (E.D. Cal.

</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 3 seeks to "write around" a seeming suggestion by Delaware's supreme court, in its 2017 <i>Williams Cos. v. Energy Transfer Equity</i> decision, that <i>commercially-reasonable efforts</i> requires the making of <b>all</b> reasonable efforts. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1175897943756751015">Williams Cos. v. Energy Transfer Equity, L.P.,</a> 159 A.3d 264, 272 (Del. 2017); see also <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9895855875544299701">Shareholder Repr. Svcs. LLC v. Alexion Pharma., Inc.</a>, No. 2020-1069-MTZ (Del. Ch. Sept. 5, 2024) (holding, after a seven-day trial, that Alexion breached a contractual requirement to use commercially reasonable efforts); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3585890316977952996">Fortis Advisors LLC v. Johnson & Johnson</a>, No. 2020-0881-LWW (Del. Ch. Sept. 4, 2024) (same, after ten-day trial). ] Curiously, the <i>Williams Cos.</i> court reached its conclusion even though the contract elsewhere had used the term <i>reasonable best efforts</i> — the court didn't address whether, under the contract-interpretation principle of <i><a href="https://dictionary.findlaw.com/definition/expressio-unius-est-exclusio-alterius.html">expressio unius, exclusio alterius</a></i>, the parties were presumed to have intended for the two terms to have different meanings
</p>

<p>
Also in <i>Williams Cos.</i> (in a dissent on other grounds), Chief Justice Strine opined that <i>commercially reasonable efforts</i> is "a comparatively strong" commitment, one that is only "slightly more limited" than best efforts. <cite> <i>See id.</i> at 276 & n.45 (Strine, C.J., dissenting) (citation omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; A more-detailed definition of <i>commercially-reasonable efforts</i> can be found in an earn-out provision of a contract by which Johnson & Johnson acquired a medical-robotics company, which stated that the term referred to <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12056670684212718028">Johnson & Johnson v.

</p>

<p>
Additionally, Section 2.07(e)(iii) forbade J&J from acting "with the intention of avoiding" any earnout payment or from factoring the cost of an earnout into post-closing business decisions. <cite>/Id./, part I.C, text acc. nn.33-34 (footnotes omitted, extra paragraphing added); see also <i>id.</i>, text acc. nn.173-74 (quoting contract). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-r-code-cond">
<p>
Business context: A customer might legitimately ask that a prospective vendor contractually commit to abiding by a "code of conduct." <cite> See, e.g., Levi Strauss & Co.'s 23-page, <a href="https://www.levistrauss.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Code-of-Conduct-English.pdf">Worldwide Code of Business Conduct</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
But some customer codes of conduct can be overreaching and overbearing — possibly trampling on the vendor's own legitimate interests and giving the customer unfair leverage in unrelated disputes. 
</p>

<p>
And for a vendor, managing compliance with many customers' different codes of conduct can be a pain (see the note to § <a href="#code-when">13.3.2</a> below). 
</p>

<p>
So, this Protocol puts "fences" around the customer's code of conduct, to help the customer and the supplier to postpone discussion of specific practices that the customer might strongly prefer or even insist on.

A commentator noted a few specific potential concerns about codes of conduct:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Audit provisions in P2P <i>[private-to-private]</i> Codes are often unrestricted in scope and lack protections for such concerns as confidentiality, waiver of attorney-client privilege, or competition-law exposure. &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
Zero-tolerance prohibitions on investment in suppliers by public officials or their families are not unheard of[. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Some P2P Codes require notification if any of the business partner’s employees or their relatives have any financial interest in the code’s sponsor — all this in this age of public companies, mutual funds and 401Ks. &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
Breach of any of these unrealistic requirements could be used as grounds for a pretextual contract termination, or withholding of payment.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: This section provides specific "off ramps" for suppliers that would find it too burdensome to comply with particular requirements of customers' codes of conduct. </aside>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 1 takes advantage of what might be thought of as "market forces" — if the Customer can't get its other suppliers to agree to comply with a given Code requirement, then that gives the Vendor more leverage in pushing back against being forced to comply. </aside>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: The term "reasonably concludes" qualifier is vague, but it should get the parties talking. </aside>

D.&nbsp; Subdivision 4 addresses the situation where the Customer, wanting an excuse to terminate a multi-year contract, unilaterally demands that the Vendor comply with costly new Code requirements.

</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Subdivision 5: The "not be seriously confusing" requirement is intended as a guardrail: The Vendor doesn't want the Customer playing "gotcha" games with carelessly- or deliberately-obfuscated Code requirements. True: The nonconfusing language requirement does leave the door open to future disputes. But the phrasing of the requirement puts a nontrivial burden of proof on the Vendor. </aside>
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; Subdivision 5: Just what would constitute a "timely" basis for providing the Code requirement might be open to debate, but the parties would at least be able to talk about it. (This could be a particular concern if the Customer were to demand that the Vendor agree to comply with the Customer's <i>future</i> changes to its code of conduct— for another approach to the future-revisions problem, see <a href="https://www.redline.net/queries/obligation-comply-unseen-or-unilaterally-imposed-policies-blank-check-or-harmless">a discussion</a> at <a href="https://www.redline.net/queries/obligation-comply-unseen-or-unilaterally-imposed-policies-blank-check-or-harmless">redline.net</a>.)
</p>

<p>
G.&nbsp; <b>Negotiation tip:</b> If the Customer is adamant in rejecting one or more of these off ramps, the Vendor could consider seeking to change the economics of the Con&shy;tract — in other words, "make it about money."

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-inspec-hist">
<p>
Here are some examples of why inspections can be appropriate and even urgently necessary:
</p>

<p>
<i>NYC building crane collapse:</i> In 2008, seven people were killed, and numerous others were injured, in the collapse of a building crane in New York City. The accident was attributed to sloppy work — and, presumably, a lack of inspection of the work — in erecting the crane. Both criminal charges and civil actions were brought against various people and companies. <cite> See, e.g., John Eligon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/nyregion/23crane.html">Rigging Contractor Is Acquitted in the Collapse of a Crane</a> (NYTimes.com 2010). </cite>
</p>


<p>
<i>Falsified earthquate safety data:</i> A Japanese firm "admitted to doctoring earthquake safety data for buildings across the country, including some venues for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics." This represented "only the latest example of corner cutting and data fudging by Japanese firms. &#x2026; industrial giant Kobe Steel admitted it falsified information on products sold to major brands including Boeing and Toyota, while care <i>[sic]</i> maker Nissan had to halt production after problems in its inspection process emerged." <cite> See, e.g., Junko Ogura and James Griffiths, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/19/sport/japan-earthquake-safety-olympics-intl/index.html">Tokyo 2020 Olympics venues linked to earthquake safety data scandal</a> (CNN.com Oct. 20, 2018). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<i>Nuclear submarine loss:</i> In April 1963, the American nuclear-powered submarine USS <i>Thresher</i> sank during post-shipyard sea trials, killing all 129 people aboard. While the cause is still debated, the Navy's initial investigation concluded that the sinking had likely resulted from defective work (on non-reactor systems) by shipyard personnel. In response, the Navy (instigated by Admiral Rickover) implemented the SUBSAFE program of rigorous inspection and testing of all materials and workmanship involved in building submarines, and the same for nuclear-reactor systems in Navy surface ships. See generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Thresher_(SSN-593)">USS Thresher (SSN 593)</a> (Wikipedia.org). 
</p>

<p>
<i>NASA spacecraft loss:</i> In 1962, NASA destroyed its Mariner 1 probe to Venus just five minutes after liftoff because the rocket was moving erratically. NASA later determined that the handwritten instructions for programming the rocket's guidance system included equations that contained the symbol "R" (for "radius"). This R, though, <i>should</i> have been R̄ ("R-bar"), i.e., an <i>average</i> of data. Because of this, the guidance-system software was incorrectly coded. That — plus a hardware glitch — caused the rocket to veer off course.  See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_1#Cause_of_the_malfunction">Mariner 1</a> (Wikipedia.org).
</p>

<p>
The Mariner 1 and <i>Thresher</i> accidents, in particular, illustrate the value of following the <b>R.O.O.M. Principle</b> — Root Out Opportunities for Mistakes (or Misunderstandings). Tragically appropriate here, a Navy version of this principle might be R.O.O.F., in which F[oul]-ups is substituted for Mistakes.
</p>

<p>
The SUBSAFE program, implemented in response to the <i>Thresher</i> disaster, is discussed above. Likewise, concerning Mariner 1, a <a href="https://timeandnavigation.si.edu/navigating-space/challenges/mariner-1-destroyed">Smithsonian Institute Web page</a> points out that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The <i>[Mariner 1]</i> disaster revealed a critical need to thoroughly debug software before launch. NASA also learned that software can be engineered <b>so that small errors do not impact safety</b>. Thanks to NASA's corrective actions, several Apollo lunar modules safely landed on the Moon despite minor software "bugs."

A.&nbsp; Many contracts defer detailed discussion of performance standards by saying, in effect, that <i>A</i> will do Such-and-Such in a "reasonable" manner.

A.&nbsp; This Definition is adapted from the definitions of "reasonable assurances" and "reasonable detail" in a U.S. statute requiring certain issuers of securities to keep books and records and maintain internal controls. See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78m">15 U.S. Code § 78m(b)(7)</a>. &bull; For related reading, see <a href="#r-best-efforts-defn">13.1</a> (best efforts); <a href="#r-comm-rsnbl">13.2</a> (commercially-reasonable efforts); and <a href="#good-faith">3.13.3</a> (good faith).
</p>





<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> When a party is obligated to use reasonable efforts, it can make sense to err on the side of doing more than just <i>what that party sees as</i> the bare minimum. That's because: &bull; the other party — or a future judge or jury — might think that the bare minimum required more than what the party did; and &bull; doing more than just the bare minimum would help show the party's good faith — always a good idea, both for business relationships and in litigation.

Federal judge Richard Posner once explained how "satisfaction" issues are adjudicated:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Suppose the manager of a steel plant rejected a shipment of pig iron because he did not think the pigs had a pretty shape. The reasonable-man standard would be applied even if the contract had an "acceptability shall rest strictly with the Owner" clause, for it would be fantastic to think that the iron supplier would have subjected his contract rights to the whimsy of the buyer's agent. At the other extreme would be a contract to paint a portrait, the buyer having reserved the right to reject the portrait if it did not satisfy him. Such a buyer wants a portrait that will please <i>him</i> rather than a jury, even a jury of connoisseurs, so the only question would be his good faith in rejecting the portrait. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=247461661244806060">Morin Building Prods.

(2) Valerie asks a passing Host-Party employee, Hans-Peter: <i>Hey, would you please hand me that wrench?</i> Hans-Peter does so. (3) In that scenario, Hans-Peter counts as "Visiting-Party people" for purposes of handing Valerie the wrench, but not for any other purpose — so if, seconds later, Hans-Peter were to punch someone in the mouth, Hans-Peter would <span class="underline">not</span> be considered "Visiting-Party people" for that purpose.

<i>Contra proferentem</i> means, approximately, "against the offeror."

Each party agrees — and no party may assert otherwise — that the Con&shy;tract is to be interpreted as though its wording resulted from the parties' informed negotiation of that wording, <b>without</b> applying the interpretive doctrine of <i>contra proferentem</i> ("against the offeror").

<p>
<i>Contra proferentem</i> can come into play if a potential ambiguity in particular contract language can't be resolved by other conventional methods — e.g., by consulting other language in the contract, and/or by considering extrinsic evidence such as course of dealing and usage in the trade. When that occurs, courts will often resolve the matter by interpreting the language against the party that drafted it and thus is "to blame" for the problem.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-contra-prof-what">
<p>
The policy basis for <i>contra proferentem</i> was explained by the Supreme Court:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Respondents drafted an ambiguous document, and they cannot now claim the benefit of the doubt. The reason for this rule is to protect the party who did not choose the language from an unintended or unfair result. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14483623828467426154">Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.</a>, 514 U.S. 52, 62-63 (1995) (reversing 7th Circuit) (citations and footnotes omitted). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>contra proferentem</i> principle is roughly analogous to the well-known "I cut, you choose" approach that is seen, for example, in what are sometimes called "shotgun" buy-sell agreements. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_choose">Divide and choose</a> (Wikipedia.org); <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/november/i-cut-you-choose-cake-cutting-protocol-inspires-solution-to-gerrymandering.html">Spice</a> (2017) (application to gerrymandering). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-contra-prof-who">
<p>
A party to a contract might have sufficient bargaining power that the party can successfully insist on using its own contract form in dealing with other parties. When that's the case, that party (i.e., the party with the bargaining power) might try to include a waiver of the <i>contra proferentem</i> doctrine in its contract form.

In some jurisdictions, courts readily enforce <i>contra proferentem</i> disclaimers; Delaware is such a jurisdiction. <cite> See <a href="https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=356230">Texas Pacific Land Corp. v. Horizon Kinetics LLC</a>, 306 A.3d 530, 549 (Del.

</p>

<p>
To similar effect is a Tenth Circuit case in which the court applied New Jersey law and the contract language in question was: "The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement is the result of negotiations so neither Party shall avail itself of any rule of construction that would resolve ambiguities against a drafting party." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9266440477343315779">ORP Surgical, LLC v. Howmedica Osteonics Corp.</a>, 92 F.4th 896, 921 n.14 (10th Cir. 2024). </cite>

<p>
<b>But:</b> Suppose that a court or arbitrator concluded that there was no way to resolve an ambiguity in a contract, other than by applying the <i>contra proferentem</i> principle — but the parties had agreed that <i>contra proferentem</i> was not to be used. The results in that situation might be unpredictable: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The tribunal might disregard the <i>contra proferentem</i> prohibition and apply the principle anyway to resolve the ambiguity; or</li>

<li>the tribunal might rule that the ambiguous provision <i>could not be enforced</i> — which in some circumstaces might jeopardize the enforceability of the entire contract. <cite> Hat tip: <a href="http://za.linkedin.com/pub/jonathan-ely/21/2b7/a80">Jonathan Ely</a>, in a comment in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groupAnswers?viewQuestionAndAnswers=&discussionID=5892147513527386114&gid=667927&commentID=5892634924455854080&trk=view_disc&fromEmail=&ut=2RduiUSJbUimk1">LinkedIn group discussion</a> (group membership required). </cite></li>

<h5 id="contra-prof-last"><span class="section-number-5">14.1.2.4.</span> Courts use <i>contra proferentem</i> only as a last resort</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-contra-prof-last">
<p>
Courts generally won't apply <i>contra proferentem</i> unless both the following are true:
</p>

<p>
<b>First:</b> A particular provision in a contract must appear to be "ambiguous" — that is, there must be two or more potentially-<i>plausible</i> meanings for the provision.
</p>

<p>
(For more on ambiguity in contracts, see <a href="#ambig-rdg">29</a>.)
</p>

<p>
If a contract provision clearly <i>isn't</i> ambiguous — for example, if one of the party-asserted meanings simply isn't plausible — then the <i>contra proferentem</i> doctrine won't come into play in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<b>Second:</b> The seeming ambiguity must not be capable of being resolved by other conventional methods — for example, by consulting other language in the contract and/or by considering extrinsic evidence such as course of dealing and usage in the trade. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The <i>[contra proferentem]</i> rule applies only as a last resort when the meaning of a provision remains ambiguous after exhausting the ordinary methods of interpretation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>At that point</b>, <i>contra proferentem</i> resolves the ambiguity against the drafter based on public policy factors, <i>primarily equitable considerations about the parties' relative bargaining strength</i>. &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Unlike contract rules that help to interpret the meaning of a term, and thereby uncover the intent of the parties, <i>contra proferentem</i> is by definition triggered only after a court determines that it <i>cannot</i> discern the intent of the parties.
</p>

<p>
When a contract is ambiguous, <i>contra proferentem</i> provides a default rule based on public policy considerations; it can scarcely be said to be designed to ascertain the meanings attached by the parties. Like the contract rule preferring interpretations that favor the public interest, <i>contra proferentem</i> seeks ends other than the intent of the parties. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3769393891809443933">Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela</a>, 587 U.S. 176, 139 S.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-contra-prof-policy">
<p>
Based as it is on public-policy considerations, the <i>contra proferentem</i> principle can be trumped by other policies. The (U.S.) Supreme Court explicitly so held in a decision where the Ninth Circuit had applied <i>contra proferentem</i> to an ambiguous arbitration provision and determined that the parties had implicitly agreed to class-wide arbitration (see generally the commentary at <a href="#arb-class">23.1.23</a>). The Court would have none of it, with the majority remarking that "[s]uch an approach is flatly inconsistent with the foundational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of consent." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3769393891809443933">Lamps Plus</a>, 139 S.

The <i>contra proferentem</i> principle might be especially important when interpreting an ambiguous provision of a standard form contract.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>12. Price: Most Favored Customer and Meet or Release</b>

&#x2013;   "The Contractor certifies that the prices, <b>warranties, conditions, benefits and terms</b> are at least equal to or more favorable than the prices, warranties, conditions, benefits and terms quoted by the Contractor to any customers for the same or a substantially similar quantity and type of service."

For a supplier, a most-favored-customer clause and price-reduction clause in a customer contract can be both dangerous and a major compliance burden. For example, the software giant <b>Oracle Corporation once paid just shy of $200 million to settle a U.S. Government lawsuit — sparked by a whistleblower claim</b> — that Oracle had overbilled the Government by knowingly charging federal customers more than allowed by an MFC clause in Oracle's federal-government contract over some eight years, according to a Department of Justice press release. <cite> See the following: • U.S. Department of Justice press release, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/oracle-agrees-pay-us-1995-million-resolve-false-claims-act-lawsuit">Oracle Agrees to Pay U.S. $199.5 Million to Resolve False Claims Act Lawsuit - Largest False Claims Act Settlement Obtained by General Services Administration</a> (Justice.gov Oct. 6, 2011) (extra paragraphing added) • Andrew Harris and David Voreacos, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-10-06/oracle-to-pay-u-s-199-5-million-to-settle-false-claim-act-investigation">Oracle Settles U.S. Agency Overbilling Case for $199.5 Million</a> (Bloomberg.com Oct. 6, 2011) (paywalled), which says in part: "The U.S. &#x2026;. claimed Oracle gave companies discounts of as much as 92 percent, while the government’s cuts ranged from 25 to 40 percent." ]
</p>

<p>
(The Oracle-employee whistleblower who reported the breach to the government <b>collected $40 million</b>, according to the DOJ press release.)
</p>

<p>
The case also attracted <b>class-action plaintiffs</b>, who sued Oracle and the members of its board directors. Various class-action lawsuits were consolidated in the Northern District of California; the cases were apparently settled on terms requiring that Oracle adopt some corporate-governance measures <i>and</i> pay $1.9 million in attorney fees. <cite> See Jessica Dye, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oracle-shareholder-suit/oracle-investor-sues-over-200-million-settlement-idUSBRE82M01T20120323">Oracle investor sues over $200 million settlement</a> (Reuters.com 2012).; <a href="http://files.courthousenews.com/2013/07/19/Stipulation.pdf">Stipulation of Settlement</a>, In re Oracle Corp.

</p>


<p>
In another case (in which my then-law firm was involved, although I wasn't), semiconductor chip maker Texas Instruments settled its patent-infringement lawsuit with Samsung in part because Samsung discovered that Texas Instruments had breached a most-favored-licensee provision in a previous patent-license agreement between the two companies — according to Samsung, when the parties had negotiated the previous license agreement, TI had fraudulently told Samsung that Samsung was getting as good a deal as any other TI licensee for the relevant patent, when apparently that proved not to be the case. <cite> See Evan Ramstad, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB849025283184778000">Texas Instruments Reaches Agreement With Samsung</a> (WSJ.com Nov. 27, 1996), archived (behind paywall) at <a href="https://perma.cc/PAC5-9VNU">https://perma.cc/PAC5-9VNU</a>; David Beck, <a href="https://goo.gl/ad33DQ">The Trial Lawyer: What it Takes to Win</a> at 235-36 (American Bar Association 2006), excerpt at <a href="https://goo.gl/ad33DQ">https://goo.gl/ad33DQ</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Both the danger and the compliance burden arise from the fact that business people doing transactions with other customers <b>often won't remember</b> that they must comply with the MFC and PRC clauses in the earlier customer contract. 
</p>

<p>
And if the business people <i>do</i> remember the MFC and PRC clauses, they might choose to ignore it, <b>to roll the dice</b> that they won't get caught.
</p>

<p>
Violating the MFC clause in a U.S. Government contract (a "GSA schedule") can lead to <b>severe consequences</b>, possibly including "government claims, prosecution under the False Claims Act (FCA), terminations for cause and suspensions and debarments to name a few." <cite> See <a href="https://www.govcontractassoc.com/most-favored-customer-clause/">Most Favored Customer Clause</a> (GovContractAssoc.com, undated). </cite>

<p>
When a supplier is asked for an MFC commitment, it helps to try to identify the specific "constituency" within the customer's organization that is asking for the commitment. It could be that it's only the procurement- or sourcing people — who often are are charged with squeezing suppliers — are reflexively pushing for an MFC commitment as an "insurance policy" to help protect their own jobs, whereas <b>the actual business customer is fine with the pricing</b> that the supplier has quoted.

When a customer asks a supplier for an MFC commitment, the supplier can try to limit the commitment. For example:

</p>

<p>
A U.S. Government manual for contracting officers (purchasers) sets out some factors that suppliers can use to try to limit an MFC clause:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
(e)  When establishing negotiation objectives and determining price reasonableness, compare the terms and conditions of the &#x2026; solicitation with the terms and conditions of agreements with the offeror’s commercial customers. 
</p>

<p>
When determining the Government’s price negotiation objectives, consider the following factors:
</p>

<p>
(1)  Aggregate volume of anticipated purchases.
</p>

<p>
(2)  The purchase of a minimum quantity or a pattern of historic purchases.
</p>

<p>
(3)  Prices taking into consideration any combination of discounts and concessions offered to commercial customers.
</p>

<p>
(4)  Length of the contract period.
</p>

<p>
(5)  Warranties, training, and/or maintenance included in the purchase price or provided at additional cost to the product prices
</p>

<p>
(6)  Ordering and delivery practices.
</p>

<p>
(7)  Any other relevant information, including differences between the &#x2026; solicitation and commercial terms and conditions <i>that may warrant differentials</i> between the offer and the discounts offered to the most favored commercial customer(s). 
</p>

<p>
For example, an offeror may incur more expense selling to the Government than to the customer who receives the offeror’s best price, 
</p>

<p>
or the customer (e.g., dealer, distributor, original equipment manufacturer, other reseller) who receives the best price may perform certain value-added functions for the offeror that the Government does not perform. 
</p>

<p>
In such cases, some reduction in the discount given to the Government may be appropriate. 
</p>

<p>
If the best price is not offered to the Government, you should ask the offeror to identify and explain the reason for any differences. <cite> General Services Acquisition Manual <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-538-federal-supply-schedule-contracting#OYRSIWIN">§ 538.270</a> (acquisition.gov) (emphasis and extra paragraphing added). </cite> &#x2013;  <b>Don't obligate the supplier's <i>affiliates</i> to the MFC commitment</b> — Sean Hogle, moderator of the redline.net online forum for lawyers, notes: "[M]ake sure the clause doesn't rope in affiliates (ie, 'Vendor <b>and its affiliates</b> warrant that the prices charged hereunder are as or more favorable &#x2026;.'). Capturing affiliates in the MFN <i>[most-favored nation]</i> clause is problematic in the M&A context, as any potential acquiror (and its affiliates) could become subject to the clause upon closing of the acquisition, depending on the structure of the deal."

<p>
From <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/dealings-supply-chain/manufacturer-imposed">the Federal Trade Commission</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Reasonable price, territory, and customer restrictions on dealers are legal. 
</p>

<p>
Manufacturer-imposed requirements can benefit consumers by increasing competition among different brands (interbrand competition) even while reducing competition among dealers in the same brand (intrabrand competition). 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For instance, an agreement between a manufacturer and dealer to set maximum (or "ceiling") prices prevents dealers from charging a non-competitive price.</li>

<li>Or an agreement to set minimum (or "floor") prices or to limit territories may encourage dealers to provide a level of service that the manufacturer wants to offer to consumers when they buy the product.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These benefits must be weighed against any reduction in competition from the restrictions.
</p>

<p>
Until recently, courts treated minimum resale price policies differently from those setting maximum resale prices. But in 2007, the Supreme Court determined that all manufacturer-imposed vertical price programs should be evaluated using a rule of reason approach. 
</p>

<p>
According to the Court, "Absent vertical price restraints, the retail services that enhance interbrand competition might be underprovided. This is because discounting retailers can free ride on retailers who furnish services and then capture some of the increased demand those services generate." Note that this change is in <i>federal</i> standards; some state antitrust laws and international authorities view minimum price rules as illegal, per se. <cite> United States Federal Trade Commission, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/advice-guidance/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/dealings-supply-chain/manufacturer-imposed-requirements">Manufacturer-imposed Requirements</a> (FTC.gov, undated) (formatting edited for improved readability). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>




<p>
<b>But:</b> In a famous Justice Department lawsuit against tech-giant Apple and a slew of legacy book-publishing houses, the Second Circuit held (over a dissent) that "to insist that the <i>vertical</i> organizer <i>[i.e., Apple]</i> <i>of a /horizontal</i> price-fixing conspiracy may escape application of the per se rule[] &#x2026; is based on a misreading of Supreme Court precedent, which establishes precisely the opposite."

<p>
In the United States, "horizontal" price-fixing among competitors is per se illegal under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1">section 1 of the Sherman Act</a> and can call down the wrath of government prosecutors and plaintiffs' lawyers. 
</p>

<p>
Corporate executives have gone to prison for price-fixing. Example: The former chief executive officer of Bumble Bee Foods was sentenced to more than four years in prison and a $100,000 criminal fine for his leadership role in a three-year antitrust conspiracy to fix prices of canned tuna; the company pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a $25 million fine — and co-conspirator StarKist was sentenced to the statutory maximum $100 million fine. <cite> See Press Release, United States Department of Justice, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-bumble-bee-ceo-sentenced-prison-fixing-prices-canned-tuna">Former Bumble Bee CEO Sentenced To Prison For Fixing Prices Of Canned Tuna</a> (June 16, 2020). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Price fixing relates <b>not only to prices, but also to other terms that affect prices</b> to consumers, such as shipping fees, warranties, discount programs, or financing rates. &#x2026; <cite> See Sandra E. Garcia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/bumble-bee-tuna-price-fixing.html">Former Bumble Bee C.E.O. Is Sentenced in Tuna Price-Fixing Scheme</a>, New York Times, June 16, 2020 ]
</p>

<p>
What kinds of inter-company dealings can be deemed "price fixing"? The U.S. Federal Trade Commission explains:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Price fixing is an agreement (written, verbal, <b>or inferred from conduct</b>) among competitors that raises, lowers, or stabilizes prices or competitive terms. 
</p>

<p>
Generally, the antitrust laws require that each company establish prices and other terms on its own, without agreeing with a competitor. When consumers make choices about what products and services to buy, they expect that the price has been determined freely on the basis of supply and demand, not by an agreement among competitors. 
</p>

<p>
When competitors agree to restrict competition, the result is often higher prices. Accordingly, price fixing is a major concern of government antitrust enforcement.
</p>

<p>
A plain agreement among competitors to fix prices <b>is almost always illegal</b>, whether prices are fixed at a minimum, <b>maximum</b>, or within some range.
</p>

<p>
Illegal price fixing occurs whenever two or more competitors agree to take actions that have the effect of raising, lowering or stabilizing the price of any product or service without any legitimate justification. 
</p>

<p>
Price-fixing schemes are often worked out in secret and can be hard to uncover, but <b>an agreement can be discovered from "circumstantial" evidence</b>. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, if direct competitors have <b>a pattern of unexplained identical contract terms or price behavior</b> together with other factors (such as the lack of legitimate business explanation), unlawful price fixing may be the reason.</li>

<li>Invitations to coordinate prices also can raise concerns, as when one competitor announces publicly that it is willing to end a price war if its rival is willing to do the same, and the terms are so specific that competitors may view this as an offer to set prices jointly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Not all price similarities, or price changes that occur at the same time, are the result of price fixing.</b> On the contrary, they often result from normal market conditions. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, prices of commodities such as wheat are often identical because the products are virtually identical, and the prices that farmers charge all rise and fall together without any agreement among them.</li>
<li>If a drought causes the supply of wheat to decline, the price to all affected farmers will increase.</li>
<li>An increase in consumer demand can also cause uniformly high prices for a product in limited supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<cite> United States Federal Trade Commission, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/dealings-competitors/price-fixing">Price Fixing</a> (accessed June 21, 2020) (formatting altered). </cite> According to the New York Times, the tuna price-fixing scheme came to light when a food wholesaler in New York noticed that prices for canned tuna were staying the same even though the price of raw tuna were dropping; this led to lawsuits by the wholesaler and by grocers such as Walmart, Target, and Kroger.

</p>

<p>
Under Michigan law, contracts for the sale of goods—including supplier contracts—are governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (the UCC).
</p>

<p>
The UCC contains a statute-of-frauds provision that governs which agreements must be in writing.  That section provides:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $1,000.00 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is a writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his or her authorized agent or broker. 
</p>

<p>
A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon[,] but the contract is not enforceable under this subsection <b>beyond the quantity of goods shown in the writing</b>. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://legislature.mi.gov/Laws/MCL?objectName=MCL-440-2201">Mich. Comp. L. § 440.2201(1)</a> (emphasis and extra paragraphing added). <b>Note:</b> In Texas, the price trigger for the statute of frauds is <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/docs/bc/htm/bc.26.htm">$500</a>, not $1,000 as in Michigan. </cite>e
</p>




<p>
The second sentence allows for some terms to be missing or incorrect but provides that a court can only enforce the contract up to the quantity set forth in writing — in other words, <b>quantity is the only essential term required by the statute of frauds</b>. 
</p>

<p>
If an agreement for the sale of goods contains a quantity, then the agreement satisfies the statute of frauds. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When a contract fails to include a quantity term, parol evidence—that is, evidence outside the contract itself cannot be offered to supply a missing quantity term.</li>

<li>In contrast, when a contract provides a quantity term but fails to express details sufficient to determine the specific or total quantity, it may be explained or supplemented by parol evidence.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The UCC allows for a contract's quantity to be measured "by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer&#x2026;." This provision allows for parties to enter into contracts that provide a quantity term but lack specificity as to the total of goods agreed upon. <cite> <a href="https://legislature.mi.gov/Laws/MCL?objectName=MCL-440-2306">MCL 440.2306(1)</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Two types of contracts</b> fall under this provision: Output contracts and requirements contracts. Both are commonly used between suppliers.  Today we formally recognize <b>a third type of contract: a release-by-release contract</b>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An "output contract" defines quantity by the supply provided by the seller.</li>

<li>In contrast, a "requirements contract" is a contract that defines quantity by reference to the buyer's requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In agreements between a buyer and supplier-seller, requirements contracts are often created by an <b>umbrella agreement</b>, which is also referred to as a "<b>blanket purchase order</b>." This umbrella agreement sets forth the terms governing items such as price, length of the contract, warranty details, indemnification, and termination. 
</p>

<p>
<i>[A federal district court opinion]</i> describes a Tier-1 supplier's supply agreement which set forth the terms and conditions for all purchase orders of a particular part or program during the life of the agreement and against which the buyer issued four purchase orders. 
</p>

<p>
Notably, a blanket purchase order itself <b>doesn't require the seller</b> actually to manufacture or ship: <i>That</i> obligation arises when the buyer issues a document referred to as a shipment‑, production‑, or release order against the blanket purchase order.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, in a requirements contract, the terms of the blanket purchase order also dictate that the buyer will obtain a set share of its total need from the seller — such as "all requirements of the buyer"). This phrase satisfies the quantity term required by the statute of frauds. 
</p>

<p>
To supplement this general term, the buyer will typically later issue "<b>releases</b>" to let the seller know its specific short-term requirements.
</p>

<p>
Finally, similar to requirements contracts, some agreements are governed by a blanket purchase order that sets the overall contract terms, and the buyer issues subsequent releases that set forth the specific quantity the buyer needs. 
</p>

<p>
But:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unlike a requirements contract, the blanket purchase order doesn't set forth the share of the buyer's need to be purchased from the supplier.</li>

<li>Instead, the purchase order is more appropriately thought of as an umbrella agreement that governs the terms of future contract offers: Although the seller isn't bound to <i>accept</i> future orders in the same manner as with a requirements contract, the seller <span class="underline">is</span> bound by the terms agreed to in the purchase order <i>when future releases are issued and accepted</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These agreements are also known as "release-by-release" contracts. Such contracts are structured so that their overarching terms are enforceable only once a firm quantity is stated — and <span class="underline">that</span> happens only when a release is issued and accepted.
</p>

<p>
The key difference between a requirements contract and a release-by-release contract rests in the level of mutual obligation between the parties and the risk each party bears. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A requirements contract assures the seller that the buyer will be a customer for the length of the contract, but the seller cannot reject future orders for the length of the contract.</li>

<li>In contrast, under a release-by-release contract, the parties' contractual obligations can expire in short order if the buyer doesn't issue a new release or the seller doesn't accept a release.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So: The seller isn't <i>guaranteed</i> future business from the buyer, but on the other hand the buyer won't know in advance whether the seller will accept a future order or instead will reject it.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-round-tripping">
<p>
Round-trip sales transactions are those in which, in essence, one company says to another, <i>You'll buy my stuff, but I'll buy enough of yours to cover your cost.</i> (It's sometimes referred to as "buying revenue.") <b>This type of deal can be a species of securities fraud</b>, and can get companies and individuals sued by the SEC and/or by securities plaintiffs <b>and even imprisoned</b>.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The SEC explained the basics of round-trip transactions in <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2005-38.htm">a press release</a> charging Time Warner (then AOL, a.k.a. America OnLine) with the practice, a charge that eventually cost Time Warner nearly $3 billion (extra paragraphing has been added for readability):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
[AOL] effectively funded its own online advertising revenue by giving the counterparties the means to pay for advertising that they would not otherwise have purchased.
</p>

<p>
To conceal the true nature of the transactions, the company typically structured and documented round-trips as if they were two or more separate, bona fide transactions, conducted at arm's length and reflecting each party's independent business purpose.
</p>

<p>
The company delivered mostly untargeted, less desirable, remnant online advertising to the round-trip advertisers, and the round-trip advertisers often had little or no ability to control the quantity, quality, and sometimes even the content of the online advertising they received.
</p>

<p>
Because the round-trip customers effectively were paying for the online advertising with the company's funds, the customers seldom, if ever, complained.
</p>
</blockquote>

AOL / Time Warner almost immediately <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002215056_sectimewarner22.html">settled with the SEC for $300 million</a>.

In some situations it can matter whether a party is considered a "merchant." As used in U.S. commercial law, the term <i>merchant</i> generally includes not only regular <i>sellers</i> of particular types of goods, but also <i>buyers</i> who regularly acquire such goods. 
</p>

<p>
The Uniform Commercial Code states as follows in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-104">UCC § 2-104</a>(1):

</p>

<p>

<p>
Contract drafters can (and often should) use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoterms#Rules_for_any_mode_of_transport">INCOTERMS 2020</a> three-letter options to instantly specify things such as responsibility for freight charges, insurance, and export- and customs clearance, in addition to passage of title (that is, ownership) and <a href="#nl-risk-of-loss">risk of loss</a>.
</p>

<p>
For example, a customer's purchase-order form might say:
</p>

<div class="alt" id="orgf6dda4b">
<p>
Shipping, etc.: DDP (Incoterms 2020).
</p>

</div>

<p>
Or: A supplier's terms of <i>sale</i> might say:
</p>

<p>
Shipping, etc.: EXW (Incoterms 2020).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-inctrms-tla">
<p>
What do these three-letter codes mean? At either extreme:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>EXW (Ex Works) means, in essence, that the supplier will make the goods available for pickup at the supplier's place of business, but everything from that point on is the customer's job.</li>

<li>DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) is the other extreme: The supplier will deliver the goods to the customer's place of business with all formalities taken care of and all charges paid.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In between are a number of other options for transferring title and risk of loss, such as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>FCA: Free Carrier (named place of delivery)</li>
<li>CPT: Carriage Paid To (named place of destination)</li>
<li>CIP: Carriage and Insurance Paid to (named place of destination)</li>
<li>DPU: Delivered At Place Unloaded (named place of destination)</li>
<li>DAP: Delivered At Place (named place of destination)</li>
</ul>

<p>
and others.

<h4 id="nl-risk-of-loss"><span class="section-number-4">15.6.3.</span> Risk of loss shifting can be quickly specified</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-risk-of-loss">
<p>
When goods are transported, it could be important to nail down the precise time at which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoterms#Allocations_of_risks_to_buyer/seller_according_to_Incoterms_2020">risk of loss</a> of the goods shifts from one party to another. Here's a not-so-hypothetical example <cite> Photo: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gaetanlee/298160434">Gaetan Lee - Creative Commons BY 2.0</a>. </cite>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Supplier," in Asia, ships thousands of rubber ducks to "Customer" in, say, California.</li>

<li>The ducks are all packed in a standard 40-foot shipping container, as called for by the contract.</li>

<li>The shipping container is transported first by truck; then by rail; then by sea; and finally again by truck to Customer's location in California.</li>
</ul>

<p>
True, <i>title</i> will pass at some point in the journey; when that happens, Customer, not Supplier, will now own the rubber ducks (and thus typically can direct what is to be done with them).
</p>

<p>
But importantly, <i>risk of loss</i> will also pass at some point in the journey — quite possibly at different point. The INCOTERMS three-letter abbreviations (see <a href="#nl-incoterms-cmt">15.6</a>, plus <a href="#orders-title">15.8.8</a>) contain succinct terms for when risk of loss will pass from a seller to a customer. 
</p>

<p>
Let's see how risk of loss might play out. Suppose that, for our shipment of rubber ducks:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>During the sea voyage a storm causes the shipping container to be washed overboard and to break open, sending the ducks floating away in different directions.</li>

<li>If risk of loss had passed to Customer <i>before</i> that time, then Supplier would have no responsibility for replacing the rubber ducks.</li>

<li>Insurance (see <a href="#nl-insurance-notes">28.24</a>) can — for a price — mitigate such risks; the parties' choice of INCOTERMS rule will establish who has responsibility for obtaining and paying for insurance.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why is this a not-so-hypothetical example? Because in basically this way, thousands of plastic yellow "rubber ducks," red beavers, blue turtles, and green frogs were once lost at sea during a Pacific Ocean storm. (Some of the toys eventually drifted thousands of miles — with the silver-lining benefit that the loss of the toys made possible some significant oceanographic research by tracking where the toys eventually washed ashore.) <cite> See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Floatees">Friendly Floatees</a> (Wikipedia.org).  ]

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-inctrm-excs">
<p>
Who must pay excise taxes and similar import duties can be a non-trivial issue, so choosing the right INCOTERMS rule can be important. EXAMPLE: In <i>Texas Truck Parts</i> (5th Cir. 2024):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Houston wholesaler had paid (under protest) some $1.9 million in excise tax on truck tires that the wholesaler had bought from Chinese manufacturers.</li>

<li>The wholesaler sought a refund of the excise tax, claiming that under U.S. tax law, the Chinese manufacturers were the "importers" of the tires and therefore were responsible for paying the tax.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It didn't work: The court held that on the facts, the wholesaler was the beneficial owner — and thus the "importer" — of the tires, and so the wholesaler was responsible for paying the excise tax. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/23-20588/23-20588-2024-10-08.html">Texas Truck Parts & Tire, Inc. v.

<h4 id="comm-proc-cs"><span class="section-number-4">15.7.1.</span> The "procuring cause doctrine" for commission eligibility</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-comm-proc-cs">
<p>
As explained by the state's supreme court, Texas law applies a fairly-simple rule to commission payments if the parties' contract doesn't specify otherwise: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
When a seller agrees to pay sales commissions to a broker (or other agent), the parties are free to condition the obligation to pay commissions however they like. But if their contract says nothing more than that commissions will be paid for sales, Texas contract law applies a default rule called the "procuring-cause doctrine." Under that rule, the broker is entitled to a commission when a purchaser was produced through the broker’s efforts, ready, able and willing to buy the property upon the contracted terms. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4899979182303775443">Perthuis v. Baylor Miraca Genetics Labs., LLC</a>, 645 S.W.3d 228, 231 (Tex. 2022) (reversing court of appeals and reinstating judgment on jury verdict awarding unpaid commissions to terminated sales executive; procuring-cause rule applied even though executive's employment was "at will") (formatting modified). See also <a href="#r-termin-at-will">20.2</a> (at-will relationships). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
A dissenting opinion argued that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The Court’s adoption of this default rule <i>[the "procuring-cause doctrine"]</i> threatens the expectations of at-will employers and employees who have agreed to a commission structure but, for whatever reason, failed to reduce it to writing with perfect clarity. 
</p>

<p>
They will be surprised to learn that, under the default rule the Court adopts today, an at-will salesperson is entitled to commissions for any sale—here, perhaps hundreds or thousands of sales—a jury determines the salesperson “set in motion.” And they will be stunned to learn that, under the default rule, the entitlement to commissions may extend <i>years</i> after their employment relationship ended. <cite> <i>Id.</i> at 244-45 (Huddle, J., dissenting) (extra paragraphing added, emphasis in original). </cite>

<h4 id="comm-proc-cs-ovrrd"><span class="section-number-4">15.7.2.</span> But: The contract can override the procuring-cause doctrine</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-comm-proc-cs-ovrrd">
<p>
EXAMPLE: A equipment-rental company, which wanted to sell itself, signed an engagement letter with a business broker.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The engagement letter specifically stated that the company would owe the broker a commission if the company completed a sale transaction within an <i>18-month</i> "tail period" after any termination of the engagement.</li>

<li>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rental company put its sale efforts on hold and terminated the engagement letter.</li>

<li>A year later, the rental company re-engaged with a prospective buyer, which had previously declined to buy.</li>

<li>This time, the prospect agreed to buy. The sale was closed 15 months after termination of the broker's engagement — i.e., during the 18-month tail period.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The broker sued the rental company for its commission; affirming summary judgment in favor of the broker, the court held that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Under Texas supreme court precedent, the specific 18-month tail period in the engagement letter overrode the procuring-cause doctrine under state law, which provided only a "default" (i.e., a gap-filler provision).</li>

<li>Consequently, said the court, the rental company did indeed owe a commission to the broker — even though the broker had not been involved with the sale transaction. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13446230600341779801">Catalyst Strategic Advisors, L.L.C. v. Three Diamond Capital SBC, L.L.C.</a>, 93 F.4th 870 (5th Cir. 2024) (affirming summary judgment). </cite></li>
</ul>

<b>Drafting tip:</b> When putting together a written commission plan, consider using one or more <a href="#rdblk">roadblock clause</a>s to make it abundantly clear when commissions are or are <i>not</i> owed.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Subdivision A: The "whenever, under The Con&shy;tract" phrase has in mind that under a vendor-customer master purchase agreements, one or more <a href="#r-affil-defn">affiliates</a> (see Protocol <a href="#r-affil-defn">22.1</a>) of the customer might have the right to make purchases under the master agreement. ¶ The term "one or more items" encompasses goods (tangible or intangible), services, and/or other items such as, for example, license rights.

<p>
<aside class="in"> Background: Some supply contracts go into great detail about just how Orders <i>must</i> be submitted and what just information must be included in them. <cite> If parties did feel compelled to put more details into the Con&shy;tract, they could look to section 2 of a Honeywell terms-of-<i>sale</i> document for sample language (archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/5MB9-H6VK">https://perma.cc/5MB9-H6VK</a>): "Orders should specify: (1) Purchase Order number; (2) Honeywell‟s part number; (3) requested delivery dates; (4) price; (5) quantity; (6) location to which the Product is to be shipped; and (7) location to which invoices will be sent for payment."] This likely would be overkill for many contracts, however, because: (1) The Vendor — especially the Vendor's sales people, who might have personal quotas to meet  — will be <b>motivated by competitive pressure</b> to make it easy for the Customer to submit Orders, for example via a hard-copy purchase Order, email, a Web-based portal; etc.; and (2) Both the Vendor's and the Customer's preferences for ordering processes might well evolve over time, so it seems <b>unwise</b> to carve such details in stone, so to speak, in the Con&shy;tract itself. </aside>

<h6 id="orgcb0f26d">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgcb0f26d">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: Under the law, if the Customer sends the Vendor a purchase order for goods or services, <i>and the Vendor ships the goods or performs the services without any accompanying "legal" paperwork of its own</i>, then any "legal" terms in the Customer's purchase order might well be binding on the Vendor as a "unilateral contract," as discussed at <a href="#fill-po">15.9.12.4</a>.  
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; On the hand, if the Vendor <i>does</i> respond with its own terms, then it'd likely cause a "Battle of the Forms" as discusssed at <a href="#nl-battle-forms">6.7</a>.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; If an Order is for the sale of <i>goods</i> (in most of the U.S.), then <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-206">UCC § 2-206</a> would come into play, allowing orders to be accepted by "prompt or current shipment &#x2026;."

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-sep-k-cmt">

<h6 id="org82e7345">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org82e7345">
<p>
A.&nbsp; <b>Alternative:</b> Each accepted Order will be considered an addition to the Con&shy;tract and not as a separate contract.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp;  <b>Caution:</b> From the Vendor's perspective, the above alternative would likely be unwise for everyday commercial orders because: (1) a default in one order could jeopardize the entire contract through "cross-default"; and (2) every new order could silently ratchet up the amount any contractual damages caps, each time increasing the vendor's financial risk.
</p>

<p>
Example: Suppose that a customer and a vendor entered into a master purchase agreement that capped the vendor's liability for damages at "the amounts paid or payable under the Con&shy;tract." If every purchase order was an addition to the contract, then the damages-cap amount would grow over time as more purchase orders were placed and filled. The vendor wouldn't be wild about that — although the customer certainly wouldn't mind it.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Tangentially: In a decision about specific damages-cap language, an English court ruled that "the correct interpretation is that there is a single cap in the Clause, as Wipro contends, and not separate caps for each claim." <cite> <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/TCC/2023/1342.html">Drax Energy Solutions Ltd. v.

A.&nbsp; Background: When a big Customer enters into a "master purchase agreement" with a Vendor, the Customer often wants the agreement to allow "affiliates" of the Customer to place Orders on the same terms and conditions and with the same pricing.

<b>Students, be sure to read this:</b>
</p>

<p>
When a vendor sells products or services to a large, "enterprise" corporate customer, the sales contract typically comes into being via the following mating dance, illustrated by this ladder diagram:
</p>


<figure id="org4948265">
<img src="./img/BattleFormsLadderDiagram.png" alt="XX" class="photocenter90">

</figure>

<p>
1.  If the (prospective) customer and the vendor haven't dealt with each other before, then the customer might send the vendor a request for <i>information</i> ("<b>RFI</b>") and/or a request for <i>quotation</i> ("<b>RFQ</b>").
</p>

<p>
(Or: If the customer wants a more-detailed proposal for the customer's specific needs, and perhaps a quotation, the customer might instead send the vendor a request for <i>proposal</i>, known as an "<b>RFP</b>.")
</p>

<p>
The customer might send the vendor an RFQ out of the blue. But often this happens because a vendor sales representative has "pitched" the vendor's products and/or services — and for big-ticket sales to large companies ("<b>enterprise sales</b>"), the overall "<b>sales cycle</b>" will often take weeks or months.
</p>

<p>
The RFQ might be a formal document labeled "Request for Quotation" or some such. 
</p>

<p>
Or, the RFQ might be just an email or oral statement to the vendor by someone working for the customer: "OK, send me a quote."
</p>

<p>
2.  In response, the vendor's sales rep sends the customer a "<b>sales quotation</b>" or "<b>quote</b>" — concerning which, see the sales-quote protocol at Protocol <a href="#r-sales-quote">15.12</a>.
</p>

<p>
3.  If and when the customer decides to buy, the customer sends the sales rep an order form such as a so-called "purchase order" or "<b>PO</b>"; typically, this will be an "offer" to purchase, which the vendor can "accept" or not. (Purchase orders are the subject of this Protocol.)
</p>

<p>
At this juncture, the vendor and customer might negotiate legal terms and conditions ("<b>T&Cs</b>"). Such legal negotiations often take awhile, especially if one side or another makes unreasonable demands. The vendor's sales people and the customer's relevant business users might get impatient — and blame "Legal" for the delay and their resulting frustration.
</p>

<p>
4.  If there won't be negotiation of the legal T&Cs, then:
</p>

<p>
4.1  The vendor's sales rep might ask the vendor's relevant people to do what's called for in the PO — e.g., ship the requested goods, perform the requested services — and send the customer an invoice. When that happens, the parties have entered into what's known as a "<b>unilateral contract</b>"; the customer's PO was an offer, which the vendor accepted by performance. (See <a href="#fill-po">15.9.12.4</a> for more discussion.)
</p>

<p>
4.2  Or: The sales rep — before getting the vendor's performance started — might respond with another document, often called an "<b>order confirmation</b>."  When this happens, the parties have entered into a so-called "Battle of the Forms," whose effects are discussed in more detail at <a href="#nl-battle-forms">6.7</a>.
</p>

<p>
5.  <b>Caution:</b> Sometimes a vendor (or an individual sales rep) might be in danger of missing its sales-target number for a fiscal quarter. In that situation, the vendor might get a cooperative customer to place a so-called "<b>round trip order</b>," where the customer places an order with the vendor but the vendor places an offsetting order for the <i>customer's</i> goods or services. 
</p>

<p>
<b>This type of deal can be a species of securities fraud</b>, and can get companies and individuals sued by the SEC and/or by securities plaintiffs and even <b>imprisoned</b>; see <a href="#nl-round-tripping">15.4</a> for examples.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-sale-pro-impede">
<p>
Customers and vendors sometimes have business processes that they would like to have followed, with, e.g., minimum- or maximum order sizes.
</p>

<p>
And sometimes a customer that submits an order to a vendor will want to change the order, or even cancel it entirely. 
</p>

<p>
It makes good business sense for the parties to have an agreed process in place for handling such situations.

<p>
Vendors will want to train their front-line people <span class="underline">not</span> to sign a customer's purchase order — nor should a <i>customer</i> sign a <i>vendor's</i> order confirmation.

<h5 id="fill-po"><span class="section-number-5">15.9.12.4.</span> Caution to Vendor: <i>Filling</i> a "PO" might agree to its terms</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-fill-po">
<p>
In U.S. law schools, first-year students learn that a so-called <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/unilateral_contract">unilateral contract</a> can be formed <i>without</i> signatures from both parties if an unrevoked, otherwise-eligible offer is accepted by performance. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Alice's cat "Fluffy" goes missing.</li>
<li>Alice posts handbills on light poles, offering a $100 reward for Fluffy's safe return.</li>
<li>Bob finds Fluffy and returns her to Alice.</li>
<li>Bob's "performance" constitutes completion of the contract, and Alice must pay Bob the reward money.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So: In U.S. jurisdictions, when a customer sends a vendor a purchase order ("<b>PO</b>"), the PO might well count as an offer to enter into a contract, <i>and the offer likely could be accepted by performance</i>, i.e., by filling the PO — making the PO's terms and conditions part of "the contract" between the parties. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Consider the following language from the giant networking-technology company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco">Cisco</a>'s "Standard Terms and Conditions of Purchase – United States" § 1 (archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/SD47-YCHU">https://perma.cc/SD47-YCHU</a>).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Vendor's electronic acceptance, acknowledgement of ths Purchase Order, or <b>commencement of performance constitutes Vendor's acceptance of these terms and conditions.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So: Suppose that Cisco sends a PO to the Vendor, and that in response, the Vendor simply ships goods to Cisco, without doing anything else — specifically, without sending the Vendor's own "paper" that pro forma rejected the Cisco terms.  Under those circumstances, the Vendor might well find itself bound by Cisco's terms — which would almost surely be more onerous to the Vendor than would the Vendor's own terms and conditions.
</p>

<p>
(If the Vendor <i>did</i> send its own rejection, then the Vendor and Cisco would likely find themselves in what's known as the Battle of the Forms, discussed at <a href="#nl-battle-forms">6.7</a>.)

Drafters can consider the following language options are provided in case the parties want to adapt one or more of them for use in the Con&shy;tract:

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At one end of the spectrum, the Vendor might want to be free to reject any order for any reason or no reason.</li>
<li>At the other extreme, the Customer might want to <i>require</i> the Vendor to accept any Customer order whatsoever.</li>

<p>
Drafters can adapt one or more of the following optional terms as desired.  <b>Caution:</b> It should be apparent that several of the options below are mutually inconsistent.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-po-chg-ord-c">
<p>
A.&nbsp; When a customer has a lot of buying power, its own standard purchase-order forms might well give the customer the right to unilaterally modify any order, <i>with the modification becoming binding on the vendor</i> if the vendor doesn't object within a certain period. 
</p>

<p>
In that vein, this Protocol draws extensively on ideas in section 17 of a (very) customer-biased Honeywell purchase order form, reproduced in the appendix at <a href="#serv-honb-chg">15.9.12.7</a> — but this section provides a simpler approach than the Honeywell version, which calls for "equitable adjustment" to pricing and/or delivery dates. 
</p>

<p>
(U.S. Government contracts sometimes use a similar equitable-adjustment approach.)
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Suppose that the Customer asks for a costly change but the Vendor doesn't follow an agreed procedure to ask for an increase in price: In such a situation, the Vendor might be stuck for the extra cost, as happened in an (unpublished) 2022 Iowa appeals court decision. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9790779032974242267">Ryan Companies U.S., Inc. v.

C.&nbsp; Subdivision B.2: For the change <span class="underline">not</span> to take effect, the Customer must <i>receive</i> the Vendor's objection within the stated time. That is: The "Mailbox Rule" (discussed at <a href="#r-notices-rule">2.8</a>) won't apply here.

<p>
A.&nbsp; This section assumes that the Vendor will want to pay commissions <i>only</i> for referrals that are genuinely useful for building out the Vendor's customer base. </aside>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: The "substantial operations" criterion is one of those that likely can be safely left up to the Vendor to determine — because if the Vendor is too stingy in that regard, then it risks finding itself getting fewer and fewer referrals from that Associate. </aside>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: A "sunset" for commission obligations can be extremely useful for certainty, which business people often value highly. EXAMPLE: In a Massachusetts case, a court held that a particular referral agreement — which didn't put a time limit on a commission obligation — required payment of commissions on sales to two customers for as long as the seller continued to do business with those particular customers. </aside <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2646647114207246080">Prism Grp., Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Subdivision 3: Legal restrictions on a Prospect's acquiring the Vendor's offerings could include, for example: (1) A Prospect might be on the <a href="https://www.trade.gov/consolidated-screening-list">Consolidated Screening List</a> of parties to whom certain <b>exports</b> (including disclosures of information) are restricted by the U.S. Government. (2) In a given territory, the Vendor's offerings might be illegal to sell to <b>persons under a certain age</b> — for example, in years gone by, different U.S. states had different ages at which individuals could buy <b>tobacco</b> and <b>alcoholic beverages</b> (but now there's uniformity thanks to federal law). </aside <cite> U.S. federal law <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/newly-signed-legislation-raises-federal-minimum-age-sale-tobacco-products-21">prohibits sales of tobacco products</a> to individuals under 21 years old, and it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act">punishes states</a> that allow sales of alcoholic beverages to those under 21 by reducing federal highway funding to those states. </cite>>
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Subdivision 4: The Vendor might rightly be concerned about <i>unwittingly</i> providing competitors with access to (for example) trade-secret computer software. </aside>
</p>

<p>
A.&nbsp; Subdivision 5: Any lack of clarity on this point could result in costly litigation. EXAMPLE: In an English case, a tech company engaged an investment bank to help the company obtain financing. As it turned out, the company obtained financing from the parent company of the tech company. The bank demanded a "success fee" anyway — but the court's answer was "no." <cite> See <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2024/3164">Kigen (UK) Ltd. v NOR Capital Ltd.</a>, [2024] EWHC 3164 (Ch), ¶¶ 90-91. </cite>

A.&nbsp; This section recognizes that as time goes on, and the Vendor (presumably) makes more sales to a referred Prospect, the sales will be less and less a result of the Associate's referral of the Prospect, and more and more a result of the Vendor's own success in dealing with the Prospect.

B.&nbsp; This section also gives the Associate an incentive to keep drumming up more new business for the Vendor, instead of "farming" commissions on old referrals.

Referral agreements should be clear on this point, because otherwise litigation might ensue from Associates wanting to get one last commission. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9550058811085184796">MAK Tech.

<p>
In sales by a vendor to a large-ish customer, a common part of the sales cycle is for a sales representative, or "rep," to send the customer a sales quotation, or "quote" (or, sometimes, "quote sheet"). If the terms are to the customer's liking, the customer will respond with a purchase order (discussed at Protocol <a href="#r-purch-ord">15.9</a>). (The vendor's sending of a quote will often be preceded by the customer's sending a request for proposal ("RFP") or a request for quotation ("RFQ").)

A.&nbsp; This section borrows from how procurement for the U.S. Government generally works: Under the Federal Acquisition Regulations, <i>quotations</i> are not offers, <i>orders</i> are. </aside <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/48/13.004">Legal effect of quotations</a>, 48 C.F.R. § 13.004. ] For similar terms, see section 1 of a <a href="https://perma.cc/5MB9-H6VKa">Honeywell terms-of-sale document</a>. </cite>>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: The "agreed to that, in writing" phrase is intended to serve as a mini-version of the Statute of Frauds: It wouldn't be good for the Vendor and the Customer to get into a dispute about whether the Vendor's sales representative supposedly said <i>orally</i> that the Quote was indeed an offer, or that the Customer could accept the quotation by simply sending in a purchase order.

<p>
Whether or not a Quote qualifies as an "offer": The Quote will expire — and so if the Quote is an "offer," the Customer will no longer be able to accept it — at the end of the business day on the date <span class="v">three months</span> after (a) the date of the Quote itself, or (b) the date of the Customer's receipt of the Quote, if the Quote is undated (so as not to penalize the Customer for the Vendor's failure to date the Quote), in either case unless: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">

<li>the Quote is an offer and the Vendor has <i>received</i> the Customer's written acceptance of the offer.</li>

<h6 id="orgba19f22">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgba19f22">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Background: A Vendor will usually want a quote to expire because the Customer might take its time deciding whether or not to buy — then, as time passes:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Vendor might stop offering the product or service that's the subject of the quote;</li>

<li>the Vendor might raise its prices above those stated in the Quote; and/or</li>

<li>the Vendor might decide, for whatever reason, that it no longer wants to deal with <i>that</i> Customer at all — perhaps because the Vendor has decided that the Customer is going to be too much trouble to work with, or perhaps the Vendor has engaged a reseller for the territory (see <a href="#r-resale-proc">15.11</a>) and now wants the Customer to deal with the reseller instead of directly with the Vendor.</li>
</ul>

<p>
(The Vendor could have other reasons, of course.)
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The three-month gap-filler expiration date for Quotes is a mirror of the three-month "gap filler" rule of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-205">UCC § 2-205</a> for purchase orders; in addition, three months is substantially equal to one fiscal quarter, which generally fits in with standard accounting practices.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> To <a href="#serv-rdr">serve the reader</a> — not least, the Customer —  the Vendor should consider putting a specific expiration date on each Quote (e.g., "This quotation will expire on December 25, 20xx") instead of making the reader compute the expiration date.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: By requiring <i>receipt</i> of acceptance of a quote by the Vendor, this subdivision intentionally goes against the "Mailbox Rule" (see <a href="#notice-3r">2.8.9</a>), under which certain contract-related communications are deemed effective <i>when mailed</i>.

<p>
The Vendor is <a href="#r-free-defn">free</a> to withdraw or modify a Quote, even if the Quote qualifies as an "offer," until such time (if any) as the Vendor <i>receives</i> the Customer's timely, <i>written</i> acceptance — the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mailbox_rule">Mailbox Rule</a> for acceptance of an offer will not apply to the Quote.

<p>
A.&nbsp; If a Quote <i>isn't</i> an offer, then of course the Vendor would be free to modify the Quote at any time, even if the Customer were to submit an order based on the Quote. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The "Vendor <i>receives</i> &#x2026; written acceptance" term is likewise intended to negate the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mailbox_rule">Mailbox Rule</a>, under which an offer would be deemed accepted, and a binding contract would be formed, as soon as the Customer mailed the acceptance to the Vendor. 
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> Obviously, a sales-savvy Vendor would be reluctant to unilaterally modify a pending Quote that a prospective Customer is in the process of considering.

<p>
In this Protocol we use the term "<i>Partner</i>" in the colloquial sense — as is commonly done in the business world — and <span class="underline">not</span> as indicating a general partnership in the legal sense. At least in theory, using the term "channel <i>partner</i>" that could be dangerous, because legally, "general partners" are jointly and severally liable for debts and liabilities that they incur in the course of the partnership's business. For a hypothetical example of such a possibility, see <a href="#PSDanger">15.15.32.3</a>.

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> If the Vendor provides a broad range of products and/or services, it might make business sense to limit the Partner's rights so that the Partner will focus on a particular Vendor product- or service line.

A.&nbsp; In some contracts, this Option might not be needed. That's because under the law in many jurisdictions, "a contract of indefinite duration is terminable at will <i>unless</i> the contract states expressly and unequivocally that the parties intend to be perpetually bound." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17835369695398865672">Compania Embotelladora Del Pacifico, S.A. v.

</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2 — <b>caution:</b> If one party is going to have the right to terminate the Channel Partnership at will, the <i>other</i> party should carefully consider putting appropriate "fences" around that right, so that the other party does not: • get caught unawares and left in the lurch, and/or • not be able to recoup its investment in the relationship.

C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> The Vendor should keep in mind that in some jurisdictions, the law prohibits a manufacturer from terminating certain dealerships without "good cause."

Here's a hypothetical example:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fred signs up Ginger to be a reseller of Fred's <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/widget">widgets</a>.</li>

<li>On his Website, Fred refers to Ginger as one of his "channel partners."</li>

<li>At a time that Ginger is engaged in promoting Fred's products, she gets into a traffic accident and injures a third party, Thierry.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course, Thierry might sue Ginger, but if Fred has more money than Ginger, then Thierry's lawyer might also try to sue <i>Fred</i> for what <i>Ginger</i> did. Thierry's likely legal theory would be that when Fred publicly referred to Ginger as a "channel partner," it had the effect of an admission by Fred that Fred and Ginger were legally in a "partnership," and therefore Fred was jointly and severally liable for the harm that Ginger caused whenever she took action in connection with the partnership's business.
</p>

<p>
Houston lawyer Temi Siyanbade offers another example: Suppose that "Susie" and "Bob" go into business as partners, and (without Susie's knowledge) Bob buys a car under the business name. If Bob falls behind on the payments, Susie likely would be responsible for the payments.

<i>On the other hand</i>, the present author has never heard of a case (and cursory research found none) in which the term "channel <i>partner</i>" led to liability.

<div id="outline-container-ChMinStd" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="ChMinStd"><span class="section-number-5">15.15.32.4.</span> Appendix: Possible minimum Partner performance standards</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ChMinStd">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Reseller agreements, referral agreements, and other channel-partner contracts sometimes set forth minimum performance requirements for the channel partner. That's because the Vendor likely wouldn't want to continue the relationship if the Partner wasn't performing. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Some examples of possible performance standards include the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>minimum number of <i>customers successfully closed</i> by the Vendor or Partner, to promote market penetration for the Vendor's products and/or services;</li>

<li>minimum <i>dollar volume of actual sales</i>, to end customers, of the Vendor's offerings;</li>

<li>minimum <i>dollar revenue</i> to the Vendor in a stated period — such a provision likely would also say that, if the Partner didn't successfully make its dollar-revenue quota for the period, then Partner could simply write a check to the Vendor for the difference; this could be thought of as a type of "take or pay" arrangement; see generally <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/takeorpay.asp">Take or Pay</a> (Investopedia.com). <b>Caution:</b> Take-or-pay can be disadvantageous to the Vendor, as discussed at <a href="#nl-take-pay-disadv-cmt">28.41.1</a>;</li>

<li>sending X number of the Partner's people to the Vendor's sales training;</li>

<li>attending X number of industry events per quarter or per year;</li>

<li>hosting X number of marketing-related events;</li>

<li>using <a href="#r-comm-rsnbl">commercially-reasonable efforts</a> in promoting sales of Vendor Offerings within the Territory.</li>
</ul>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Ideally, the Con&shy;tract should specify what would happen if the Partner were to <i>fail</i> to perform to agreed performance requirements — this could include, for example (and after any cure period specified in the Con&shy;tract), the Vendor's having the right (by notice) to terminate the Channel Partnership, and with it, the Partner's rights (on a going-forward basis.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> The Vendor should keep in mind that it might want to grant some other partner an <i>exclusive</i> right in the Territory — but if the Vendor were to terminate Partner A and then sign a deal with Partner B, the terminated Partner A could claim that the termination was improper; see <a href="#termin-own-goal">20.9.2.4</a> for examples of some cases where similar things have happened.
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; As time goes on, the Partner's performance standards could be made more stringent, to provide the Partner with an initial "break-in" period.
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; Performance standards could also provide for additional compensation to the Partner if the Partner <i>overachieves</i> the stated performance targets.
</p>

<p>
G.&nbsp; Parties could also consider specifying some kind of performance improvement plan, as provided at Protocol <a href="#r-perf-improv">17.6</a>; this could entail some kind of adjustment to the economics, e.g., a reduction in a reseller's discount or a referral source's commission rate.

A.&nbsp; If the Defender "steps up" and provides a defense, then the <i>Defender</i> should be able to control the defense. Otherwise, the Beneficiary-hired lawyer — knowing it won't be <i>the Beneficiary</i> that will eventually be paying the bills — might be tempted to put on a costly, overly-thorough ("gold-plated") defense that the lawyer might not have done otherwise. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: JPMorgan Chase found itself being billed for some $60 million for the legal fees of a woman who was sentenced to seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan when she sold her company to the bank. As the NY Times reported: "JPMorgan said in a filing last month that Ms. Javice engaged five separate law firms, and that she and her lawyers have treated the original ruling forcing the bank to pay for her defense as a 'blank check to bill and expense whatever they please.' The stable of lawyers that she has used have also represented Elon Musk, Harvey Weinstein and Sam Bankman-Fried. <cite> Ron Lieber, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/business/charlie-javice-jpmorgan-legal-bills.html?unlocked_article_code=1.1U8.cdob.8xD17BBNY2QR&smid=url-share">She Took JPMorgan for $175 Million.

{ {{UN}}} This section doesn't require the Beneficiary to <i>formally tender the defense</i> to the Defender.

A.&nbsp; In many cases where the Defender must defend the Beneficiary:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <i>Defender</i> is likely to want to have its own regular legal counsel be the ones to represent the Beneficiary and run the defense.</li>

<li>But the Beneficiary might reasonably want its own counsel to keep an eye on what the Defender's lawyers are doing — even though, under legal ethics in the U.S. (and probably in other jurisdictions as well), an attorney's loyalty is owed to <i>the client</i>, not to a third party that's paying the bills, so that <i>the Defender's</i> legal counsel will be ethically obligated to be loyal to the <i>Beneficiary</i>.</li>

C.&nbsp; In this Protocol, we intentionally don't address what would happen if the parties couldn't reach agreement about  about a Beneficiary request to admit or waive something.

This is a more-balanced approach than releasing the defense obligation entirely — that can happen, for example, in some insurance policies, in which the Beneficiary (the insured) loses <i>any</i> right to defense <i>or</i> indemnity if the Beneficiary doesn't advise the Defender (the insurance carrier) of the claim within a specified time period (often 30 days).
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Delaware chancery-court case, the <i>buyer</i> of a company failed to notify the company's <i>sellers</i> of a government claim against the company. The buyer also didn't give the sellers an opportunity to participate in the company's defense against the government's claim. As a result, the buyer was precluded from tapping a $100 million escrow of money from the purchase price, which the parties had set aside to fund payment of indemnified claims. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3973129928607942021">LPPAS Representative, LLC v.

A.&nbsp; The Defender might find it desirable to defend the Beneficiary against a claim even if Beneficiary itself was uninterested because the Beneficiary felt it had little or no real skin in the game.

B.&nbsp; Here's a hypothetical example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A patent owner sues a supplier's <i>customer</i> for <i>using</i> a supplier's products, on grounds that the products supposedly infringe the patent.</li>

<li>The customer is indifferent, because the customer can get by without using the supposedly-infringing products.</li>

<li>But the <i>supplier</i> might care very much: an adverse judgment in favor of the patent owner might have adverse consequences for the supplier, e.g., under some form of <i>res judicata</i> or collateral estoppel.</li>

So: This section requires the Beneficiary to provide <i>reasonable</i> cooperation in any event. Of course, just what constitutes "reasonable" cooperation might depend in part on the nature and extent of the Beneficiary's potential liability exposure.

Contractual defense obligations can become especially important if a catastrophic event occurs, such as an oil-well blowout — and if the relevant contract has been <i>assigned</i> (see <a href="#r-assmt-consent">17.3</a>), then things can get even more, let's just say, <i>interesting</i> — see, e.g., the <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/18-20453/18-20453-2020-02-21.pdf#page=6">contract diagram</a> reproduced in a Fifth Circuit opinion in the aftermath of a catastrophic 2013 oil-well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3878212232685913329">Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London v.

Here are a couple of hypothetical but typical examples of contractual defense obligations:
</p>

<p>
1.  A customer sends a vendor a purchase order for specified goods. The purchase order's detailed terms and conditions require the vendor to defend the customer against any claim that the goods infringe the intellectual-property rights of any third party.
</p>

<p>
2.  A master services agreement calls for the service provider to conduct background checks on certain provider personnel. The agreement states that the provider must defend the customer against any claim that a background check was conducted in a way that violated applicable privacy law.

<h3 id="r-fmaj"><span class="section-number-3">16.2.</span> Force Majeure Protocol</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-r-fmaj">
<p>
In limited circumstances, the law allows parties to contracts to invoke the doctrine of "force majeure" as defenses to excuse their failure to timely meet their contractual commitments. This Protocol establishes a procedure for parties to do so.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> Force majeure is an area where the law can vary, so contract drafters should be familiar with recent developments in the law — or consult experienced counsel — especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant supply-chain disruptions. <cite> See, e.g., Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pitman LLP, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/tour-de-force-force-majeure-in-civil-12543/">Tour de Force: Force Majeure in Civil Law Jurisdictions – A Superior Force Majeure Doctrine?</a> (JDSupra.com 2020); <a href="https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/tour-de-force-3.html">Tour de Force: Do the Current Economic Conditions Caused by COVID-19 Constitute a Force Majeure Event?</a> (2020). </cite>

<p>
When this Protocol is agreed to, each stated party — referred to in this protocol as the "<b>Affected Party</b>" or "<b>AP</b>" — may assert force majeure, in accordance with this Protocol, to excuse a failure to timely perform the Affected Party's obligations under the Con&shy;tract.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: In some circumstances it might be best for a party to invoke force majeure in advance — for example, if a hurricane were approaching or a pandemic were erupting — to give both parties a chance to prepare and, with any luck, to prevent or at least mitigate the expected ill effects.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: EXAMPLE: A California appeals court affirmed a summary judgment that a brew pub couldn't use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse for not paying rent to its landlord: the brew pub — which was part of a large chain of restaurants and bars — <i>could</i> have paid its rent notwithstanding the pandemic. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10674493899724430264">West Pueblo Partners, LLC v. Stone Brewing Co., LLC</a>, 90 Cal. App. 5th 1179, 1188-90 (Cal. App. 2023). The court reviewed COVID-era case law from other jurisdictions as well. </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Similarly, an appeals court held that a Texas-based natural gas pipeline company would have to <b>prove</b>, at trial, that its curtailment of gas deliveries to a customer had <b>in fact</b> been caused by emergency government orders issued in response to 2021's Winter Storm Uri, which reportedly came within minutes of plunging nearly the entire state of Texas into a weeks-long blackout. The customer asserted that the pipeline company's curtailment had been caused instead by the customer's invocation of its contractual option to sell back its right to the gas deliveries. The customer claimed that because of its sell-back, the pipeline company supposedly owed the customer some $100 million — which the pipeline company had refused to pay, citing force majeure. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15960896287855396026">Freeport LNG Marketing, LLC v. Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC</a>, No. 14-22-00864-CV, slip op (Tex. App&#x2013;Houston [14th Distr.] Apr. 15, 2025) (reversing and remanding summary judgment in favor of pipeline company).

<p>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: On the other hand, in another case arising from Winter Storm Uri, a federal-court jury in Houston found that natural-gas producer Marathon Oil Company <b>had</b> shown that its failure to deliver gas to Koch Energy Services came within (and was excused by) the contract's force majeure clause. <cite> See Press release, <a href="https://azalaw.com/aza-defeats-123-7-million-breach-of-contract-claim-in-first-major-winter-storm-uri-natural-gas-trading-jury-trial/">AZA Defeats $123.7 Million Breach of Contract Claim in First Major Winter Storm Uri Natural Gas Trading Jury Trial</a> (AZALaw.com May 6, 2025); see also <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/txsdce/4:2021cv01262/1823398/324/">Marathon Oil Co. v.

The Affected Party cannot use force majeure as an excuse for not timely paying an amount due under the Con&shy;tract, <b>unless</b> the Affected Party's failure is or was due to generalized failure — beyond the Affected Party's control — in all reasonably-available payment systems, such as (for example):

<li>all of the following are true: (a) substantially all of the Affected Party's assets that the Affected Party could use for payment are trapped or stranded in one or more failed banks, (b) the Affected Party had no reason to anticipate that this would happen, <i>and</i> (c) the Affected Party could not move enough assets to make the payment; or</li>

<h4 id="r-fmajdefn"><span class="section-number-4">16.2.4.</span> Definition: <i>Force majeure</i></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-r-fmajdefn">
<p>
The term "<b>force majeure</b>" refers to any situation — which could be an event, or a series of related- and/or independent events — in either or both of the following two categories: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the situation is of a specific type listed in the Con&shy;tract as constituting force majeure — if any — or a situation of a similar kind or nature, in any case regardless whether or not the situation was foreseeable at the time the parties entered into the Con&shy;tract; <b>and/or</b></li>

<li>the situation was <i>unforeseeable</i> at the time the parties entered into the Con&shy;tract, whether or not similar to a specific type that's listed in the Con&shy;tract.</li>

<h6 id="orgfd5a15f">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgfd5a15f">
<p>
A.&nbsp; This definition is largely based on the general law; it's adapted from a Fifth Circuit approach as adopted by the Texas court of appeals in Houston. </aside <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4325488750852613640">TEC Olmos, LLC v. ConocoPhillips Co.</a>, 555 S.W.3d 176, 182 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2018, pet. denied) (citing cases).] Also, it's intentionally located at the end of this protocol, instead of right at the outset. That's because anecdotal evidence suggests that this can help speed reader comprehension, according to Tim Cummins, the former head of a global association of contract professionals. <cite> See Tim Cummins, <a href="https://commitmentmatters.com/2014/07/21/change-does-not-have-to-be-complicated/">Change does not have to be complicated</a> (July 21, 2014). </cite>>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> In <b>New York</b> and possibly in some other jurisdictions, <b>it might be <i>necessary</i> to include a "laundry list"</b> of specific types of situation that the parties intend to qualify as force majeure — and a catch-all such as the "of a similar kind or nature" phrase here <b>might not work</b>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9397896147756101823">Kel Kim Corp. v. Central Markets, Inc.</a>, 70 N.Y.2d 900, 902-03 (1987) (insurance-industry crisis did not excuse commercial tenant's failure to renew insurance as required by lease), <i>quoted in</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16772696473866383440">JN Contemporary Art LLC v. Phillips Auctioneers LLC</a>, 29 F.4th 118, 124 (2d Cir. 2022) (COVID-19 pandemic qualified under contract's force-majeure clause). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Moreover, in New York the force majeure event must actually render performance <b>impossible</b>, not merely uneconomical. <cite> See generally Andrew Lucano, <a href="https://www.seyfarth.com/news-insights/performance-under-contracts-governed-by-new-york-law-in-the-face-of-the-covid-19-pandemic.html">Performance under Contracts Governed by New York Law in the Face of the COVID-19 Pandemic</a> (Seyfarth.com 2020).

</p>

<p>
At the invaluable redline.net forum for lawyers, forum moderator Sean Hogle <a href="https://www.redline.net/queries/new-york-law-force-majeure-vendor-not-great">points out</a> that "New York force majeure law for vendors and service providers is brutal. &#x2026; You need a list. The doctrine will excuse performance under New York law only if the force majeure clause specifically includes the event or occurrence that prevents a party’s performance. Without a list, the clause is basically a dead letter."

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Some customers might want their suppliers to commit to using "best efforts" to mitigate or remediate the effects of force majeure. A supplier, however, might be reluctant to agree to a best-efforts commitment because different courts might define that term in different ways and the likelihood of being second-guessed after the fact, as discussed in the commentary to Protocol  <a href="#r-best-efforts-defn">13.1</a> (best efforts definition). <cite> An example of such a force-majeure mitigation commitment can be seen in section 4 of <a href="https://perma.cc/84BS-KYXB">a Honeywell purchase-order form</a>, apparently from February 2014 (archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/84BS-KYXB">https://perma.cc/84BS-KYXB</a>). </cite>

For example, in <a href="https://www.autonews.com/suppliers/stellantis-shifts-risk-suppliers">April 2022</a>, "Stellantis' new purchase contracts declare[d] 'all future events are deemed foreseeable' by suppliers, yet require[d] price reductions when any savings are found." Noting this <i>astonishingly</i>-brazen move, a Harvard Business School professor mused, "One has to wonder if anyone could foresee the events of the past two years," i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic and the protracted Russian invasion of Ukraine. <cite> Willy C. Shih, <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/04/in-uncertain-times-big-companies-need-to-take-care-of-their-suppliers">In Uncertain Times, Big Companies Need to Take Care of Their Suppliers</a> (HBR.edu 2022). </cite>

<p>
OEMs should recognize that a major benefit of having multiple suppliers is resiliency, and while competition between them will ensure fair pricing, it should not be used as a tool to drive a race to the bottom. 
</p>

<p>
Some firms already have a more enlightened view. For decades, Toyota has ensured that it understands a supplier’s costs and then negotiates prices without repeated rounds of threats. It also works with individual suppliers to improve their productivity and performance. 
</p>

<p>
"You can sit and have conversations. They actually care," the CEO of one [supplier] company told me. "I don’t have the potential to make as much money [with them], but the business is really solid, very stable."

A.&nbsp; The Texas supreme court has repeatedly held that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<i>[An indemnity provision]</i> in a contract which fails to satisfy either of the fair notice requirements when they are imposed is unenforceable as a matter of law. 
</p>

<p>
One fair notice requirement, <b>the express negligence doctrine</b>, requires that the intent of the parties must be specifically stated in the four corners of the contract.
</p>

<p>
The other requirement, of conspicuousness, mandates that something must appear on the face of the contract to attract the attention of a reasonable person when he looks at it.
</p>

<p>
Language may satisfy the conspicuousness requirement by appearing in larger type, contrasting colors, or otherwise calling attention to itself. 
</p>

<p>
However, if both contracting parties have actual knowledge of the plan's terms, an agreement can be enforced even if the fair notice requirements were not satisfied. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9145864340893355945">Storage & Processors, Inc. v. Reyes</a>, 134 S.W.3d 190, 192 (Tex. 2004) (affirming court of appeals's reversal of summary judgment in favor of employer: employee's release of claims in benefit plan did not satisfy fair-notice requirements) (cleaned up, lightly edited).)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Some Texas lawyers used the term "express negligence doctrine" as a shorthand expression encompassing <b>both</b> the fair-notice requirements of being <b>express</b> and <b>conspicuous</b>, <cite> See, e.g., Byron F. Egan, <a href="https://www.jw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-Express-Negligence-Doctrine-by-Byron-Egan.pdf">Indemnification in M&A Transactions for Strict Liability or Indemnitee Negligence: The Express Negligence Doctrine</a>, U.

A.&nbsp; This section is intended to deal with an apparent split in the case law as to whether an indemnity obligation must be "unmistakably clear" that the obligation <i>does</i> or does <i>not</i> cover claims between the parties themselves.<sup><a id="fnr.ClayBar" class="footref" href="#fn.ClayBar" role="doc-backlink">31</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Suppose that an indemnity clause provision requires <i>A</i> to indemnify <i>B</i> if <i>A</i> breaches its contract obligations. A court could well hold that the provision was a <i>first-party</i> indemnity clause — at least on the subject of attorney fees.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: This happened in a Federal Circuit case where a <a href="#r-conf-info-proto">confidentiality agreement</a> (a.k.a. "NDA") called for the parties to "hold harmless the other against any and all damage, losses or liability (including reasonable attorneys' fees) suffered by the other <b>as a result of any breach</b> of the representations, warranties, and agreements set forth herein." (Emphasis added.) The court affirmed a trial-court holding that this indemnity language — as a so-called first-party clause — overrode the "<a href="#r-atty-fees-am-rule">American Rule</a>" for attorney fees (see Option), allowing the successful plaintiff to recover its attorney fees for pursuing its breach-of-contract claims. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3358739901067764223">ams-OSRAM USA Inc. v. Renesas Elecs. America Inc.</a>, 133 F.4th 1337, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2025) (affirming trial court's award of attorney fees).

</p>

<p>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: On the other hand, the Tenth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion in a case where the indemnification provision contained similar breach-oriented language. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9266440477343315779">ORP Surgical, LLC v.

A.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: This might be a point for negotiation.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2 would probably be the default mode under the law in most U.S. jurisdictions. The rationale is that allowing a party to shuck off liability for its own willful misconduct would create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard">moral hazard</a> and be against public policy.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 3's exclusion of consequential damages is meant to avoid positioning a reimbursing party as an insurer for another party's <i>unusual</i> losses, etc., unless the parties have affirmatively specified otherwise. 
</p>

<p>
Why include this? Because in Anglo-American jurisprudence, damages for <i>breach</i> of contract are generally limited to those that are not only <i>foreseeable</i>, but within the contemplation of <i>both</i> parties as possibly occurring in the usual course; this section does the same for indemnity obligations.

<p>
A.&nbsp; This is a "sunset" provision, akin to how insurance policies frequently include deadlines for the insured to report third-party claims to the insurance carrier.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Such a deadline proved fatal to Harvard University's claim for coverage of some of its legal-defense costs in the famous <i>SFFA</i> litigation, which ultimately led to the Supreme Court's holding that race-based affirmative action in college admissions was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=275673022653750794">Harvard Coll. v. Zurich American Ins. Co.</a>, 77 F.4th 33 (1st Cir. 2023) (affirming summary judgment dismissing Harvard's claim against excess-insurance carrier). Harvard's excess-insurance claim was for expenses incurred in a high-profile case that ended up at the (U.S.) Supreme Court, in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf">Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll.</a>, 600 U.S. 181, 143 S. Ct. 2141 (2023). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Drafters for prospective indemnity beneficiaries should think carefully before agreeing to such a "sunset" date for indemnity obligations; that's especially true for indemnities concerning situations that might not come to light for years, such as claims arising from unseen pollution and other environmental problems. <cite> This is discussed in detail in Laurence S.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Any time you propose a clause requiring another party to <b>indemnify</b> your client, it's important to think about whether also to propose asking the other party to agree to maintain <b>insurance</b> (see <a href="#nl-insurance-notes">28.24</a>) to provide a backup source of funding for the indemnity obligation. 
</p>

<p>
These two subjects, <i>indemnification</i> and <i>insurance</i> — or "I&I" for short — should go hand in hand. (See the <a href="https://www.acronymfinder.com/Intercourse-and-Intoxication-(GI-update-of-R%26R)-(I%26I).html">bawdy military version</a> of that expression, from what Americans refer to as the Vietnam war.)
</p>

<p>
Here's why: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Suppose that Fred contractually commits to indemnifying Ginger if certain things happen.</li>

<li>But when one of those things happen, and Ginger wants Fred to indemnify her, it turns out that Fred has no money or other assets, at least none to which Ginger could successfully lay claim in court.</li>

<li>In that situation, Ginger would very likely be unable to get any meaningful compliance from Fred — and she might even have to deal with the challenges of a <a href="https://fullertonlaw.com/bankruptcy-primer-for-creditors#_Toc10942650">bankruptcy</a> filing by Fred.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>AND:</b> The reverse is true <b>if you're <i>reviewing</i> a clause</b> that would require your client to indemnify another party: Consider suggesting to your client that the client <b>check with its insurance broker</b>, to increase the chances that the client has appropriate coverage — and to reduce the chances that the disgruntled client might sue <i>you</i> for for failing to make that suggestion, hoping to recover from your malpractice insurance.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> <a id="org801331a"></a> As the Fifth Circuit explained: "The Texas Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act ('TOAIA') voids indemnity agreements that pertain to wells for oil, gas, or water or to mineral mines, unless the indemnity agreement is supported by, <i>inter alia</i>, liability insurance" — <i>and the Payer's liability for indemnity is limited to the dollar amount of insurance that the Payer is contractually required to maintain</i>, even if the Payer happens to maintain more insurance than that. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16340929839143057009">Cimarex Energy Co. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-indem-wdg">
<p>
An indemnification provision might be worded in such a way as to force a protected party to jump through some proof hoops. EXAMPLE: Nissan's North America operation bought brake assemblies and parts from Continental Automotive. The brakes on one Nissan failed, apparently due in part to bad design choices by Nissan engineers (and a technical error in Continental-supplied software). Three people in another car were killed. Hit with a $24 million jury verdict, Nissan demanded indemnity (reimbursement) from Continental Auto Parts. 
</p>

<p>
But the indemnity language in Nissan's purchase order said (in relevant part): 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
8.  &#x2026; Seller’s liability shall also include &#x2026; damages or cost arising from claims of personal injury or property damages caused directly or indirectly by defective parts supplied by Seller.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nissan argued: "Paragraph 8 requires Continental to indemnify Nissan for expenses arising from <i>claimed</i> defects in Continental parts." (Emphasis in court's opinion.) 
</p>

<p>
Continental responded that it would be liable under paragraph 8 for "actual—not alleged—defects in its products, and then only when the actual defect is to blame for the harm to Nissan."
</p>

<p>
Affirming summary judgment for Continental, the Sixth Circuit ruled:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
By the terms of the contract, the district court held, Continental must indemnify Nissan where Continental’s defective parts <i>caused</i> injury or property damage. Nissan could establish this either by (1) showing a preclusive finding that a Continental defect caused a relevant injury or (2) litigating that issue in the first instance in the indemnification action. We agree with this assessment of the contract. And we agree that <b>because Nissan did neither, it cannot recover.</b> #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15192713292759048429">Nissan N. Am., Inc. v.

<p>
<b>Students in Texas and California: This is important.</b>
</p>

<p>
Section <a href="#r-indem-def-excl-express-negl">16.3.4</a> reflects the so-called "express negligence doctrine" in jurisdictions such as California and Texas: Even if Ginger is contractually obligated to indemnify Fred against losses, Ginger need <i>not</i> indemnify Fred from losses caused <i>by Fred's own negligence</i> or gross negligence <b>unless</b> the contract <b>expressly</b> and <b>conspicuously</b> so states. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8103207132419768965">Crawford v. Weather Shield Mfg. Inc.</a>, 44 Cal. 4th 541, 552 (2008); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1749239368162039064">Dresser Industries v. Page Petroleum, Inc.</a>, 853 S.W.2d 505, 508 (Tex. 1993) (conspicuousness requirement); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17912707057754664928">Ethyl Corp. v. Daniel Constr. Co.</a>, 725 S.W.2d 705, 708 (Tex. 1987) (express-negligence doctrine). See generally, e.g., Byron F. Egan, <a href="http://images.jw.com/com/publications/2020.pdf">Indemnification in M&A Transactions for Strict Liability or Indemnitee Negligence: The Express Negligence Doctrine</a> (JW.com 2014), archived at <a href="http://perma.cc/RS63-FWKE">http://perma.cc/RS63-FWKE</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> In Texas, <b>advance releases of negligent conduct</b> must likewise be both express and conspicuous; in its 1993 <i>Dresser Indus. v. Page Petroleum</i> decision, the Texas supreme court held that "the fair notice requirements of conspicuousness and the express negligence doctrine apply to both indemnity agreements <i>and to releases</i> in the circumstances before us &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1749239368162039064">Dresser Industries v. Page Petroleum, Inc.</a>, 853 S.W.2d 505, 509 (Tex. 1993) (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Similarly, California courts distinguish between "active negligence" and "passive negligence" in the context of a contractual release or exemption from liability:
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> In some places, an indemnity obligation — other than in an insurance policy — might be flat-out unenforceable to the extent it purports to protect a party from its own negligence. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2646137607436461196">Ashley II of Charleston, L.L.C. v. PCS Nitrogen, Inc.</a>, 409 S.C. 487, 490-92, 763 S.E.2d 19 (S.C. 2014). </cite>
</p>

<p>
And in some jurisdictions, "anti-indemnity" statutes nullify certain indemnity obligations outright. <cite> See <a href="https://www.grsm.com/Templates/media/files/pdf/50%20State%20Legal%20Matrices%202024_FINAL.pdf#page=3.12">Anti-Indemnity Statutes</a>, in Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani, <a href="https://www.grsm.com/Templates/media/files/pdf/50%20State%20Legal%20Matrices%202024_FINAL.pdf">50 State Legal Matrices for 2024</a> (grsm.com). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-indem-ser">
<p>
A contractual right to be indemnified can have serious financial implications, especially if a catastrophic event occurs — an <i>indemnifying</i> party might find itself on the hook for millions of dollars. EXAMPLE: In a 2018 decision, the Nebraska supreme court affirmed an indemnification award of $108.9 million after an explosion in a food-processing plant that killed 3 people and injured more than 60 others. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8970922713049330056">Jacobs Eng'g Group Inc. v. ConAgra Foods, Inc.</a>, 301 Neb. 28, 917 N.W. 2d 435, 444 (2018). ]
</p>

<p>
And if the relevant contract has been <i>assigned</i>, things can get even more "interesting." EXAMPLE: See the <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/18-20453/18-20453-2020-02-21.pdf#page=6">diagram</a> of the interparty relationships and their indemnity obligations, in a 2020 Fifth Circuit decision in the aftermath of an oil-well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3878212232685913329">Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London v. Axon Pressure Prods. Inc.</a>, 951 F.3d 248 (5th Cir. 2020). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Even with only an <i>implied</i> indemnity obligation, the extent of liability could be significantly greater than anticipated. EXAMPLE: An English couple contracted with a tour operator for a 15-day vacation package in Sri Lanka, including air fare and hotel. During their stay at the hotel, the wife was raped by a hotel maintenance worker. The UK Supreme Court held that the tour operator was liable <i>for breach of contract</i> —  the contract said in part:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>[W]e will accept responsibility</i> if due to <i>fault on our part, or that of our agents</i> or suppliers, any part of your holiday arrangements booked before your departure from the UK is not as described in the brochure, or <i>not of a reasonable standard</i>, or if you or any member of your party is killed or injured as a result of an activity forming part of those holiday arrangements. &#x2026; <cite> <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2018-0102-judgment-1.pdf">X v. Kuoni Travel Ltd.</a>, [2021] UKSC 34, paras. 2, 50 (reversing judgment of court of appeal) (emphasis added, citations omitted). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
Notably, the supreme court held that the tour operator was <i>directly</i> liable for breach of contract, and that vicarious liability was not relevant.

Consider the following hypothetical situation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You're a provider of construction-related services. As part of your contract with a customer, you agree to indemnify the customer against any damages or other harms that result from your services.</li>

<li><p>

<p>
(In contrast to a statute of limitations, a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/statute_of_repose">statute of repose</a> cuts off liability at a specified date, even if no injury has yet occurred.)
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Question: Are you, the service provider, off the hook? Possibly not. In a Massachusetts case, the state's highest court consider a situation such as the one described in our hypothetical above:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An architecture firm (the "architects") contracted with Boston University ("BU") to design a new, artificial-turf athletic field for BU. The field was to be be located above an underground parking garage, which the architects would also design.</li>

<li>The contract included <b>a specifically-negotiated indemnity obligation</b>: If the architects' negligence resulted in defects in the field's design, then the architects would have to indemnify BU for any and all resulting expenses.</li>

<li>And sure enough: In the parking garage under the athletic field, it turned out that seasonal changes in the weather led to the joists' expanding and contracting. (Remember, this was Boston.)  The architects' design for the field hadn't taken that into account, so the field sagged in places; this made the field unsafe to use for sports events.</li>

<li>The school went ahead and fixed the problems with the field and sent the bill to the architects — who declined to pay.</li>

<li>The relevant statute of <i>repose</i> imposed a deadline of six years to bring a action for negligence.</li>

<li><i>More</i> than six years after the field first opened, BU sued the architects <i>for breach *of the indemnification provision</i>.*</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court held that the state's statute of repose did <span class="underline">not</span> bar BU's contract claim for indemnity, in essence because <i>that</i> claim had accrued when the architects refused to honor the indemnity provision. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9583906959204440765">Trustees of Boston Univ. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-16-3-13-6">
<p>
It can make sense to ask The Other Side of the Deal for a defense-and-indemnity obligation any time <i>A</i> might get sued <i>by a third party</i> because of something that <i>B</i> might have done (or failed to do). 
</p>

<p>
For example, it might make sense for <i>A</i> to ask <i>B</i> for an indemnity obligation if <i>A</i> is one of the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a manufacturer that engages a reseller to sell the manufacturer's products to end-customers, where the reseller's people will be dealing with customer employees — and those customer employees conceivably might sue Argon for something that the reseller did to sell Argon's products;</li>
<li>a vendor that agrees to pay commissions to a referral source for customer <i>referrals</i>;</li>
<li>a service provider that engages an agency to perform background checks on key personnel in jurisdictions where consent is legally required;</li>
<li>a customer that allows a provider's people to come onto the customer's site, or to access the customer's computer system;</li>
<li>a university laboratory that provides vaccine-manufacturing instructions to a Big Pharma drug manufacturer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In each of these cases, <i>A</i> might want <i>B</i> to agree to a defense-and-indemnity obligation to protect the client from third-party claims arising from <i>B</i>'s misconduct — whether that misconduct is, say, a car accident that injures a bystander; sexual assault or harassment of a customer employee; etc.

On the other side of the coin: A reseller that agrees to "rep" a manufacturer's products might want <i>the manufacturer</i> to agree to defend and indemnify against warranty- and product-liability claims concerning those products. The same might be true for a party that signs a contract with the manufacturer to be paid commissions for customers referred to the manufacturer; on that subject, see the Referrals Protocol (<a href="#r-refer-proc">15.10</a>).

In some transactions, one party will be far better able to bear the financial risks of the parties' dealings together. In such a transaction, the "smaller" party might to see if the larger party will agree to defend and indemnify the smaller party against claims, <i>even if the smaller party was allegedly at fault</i>, as part of their overall economic bargain.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: a small geophysics analysis firm does Big Data number-crunching to help oil-and-gas "majors" locate likely deposits. If an error by the small firm could allegedly cause significant harm to third parties, then the small firm might ask for a major to indemnify and defend the small firm against claims over a specified maximum.

<li>"Harry" threatens Ginger with a lawsuit;</li>
<li>Ginger pays Harry to go away; and</li>
<li>Ginger claims that Fred must reimburse her for what she paid to Harry.</li>
</ul>

<p>
QUESTION: Is Ginger correct?
</p>

<p>
Nebraska's supreme court explained the general rule:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
[W]hether the party seeking indemnity paid [to] a third party <i>under legal obligation</i> is a central question in determining if an obligation to indemnify arises by operation of law. This has obvious ramifications when a party claims a right to indemnity by operation of law after settling a claim with a third party. 
</p>

<p>
In that circumstance, <b>a party seeking indemnity must generally prove that it was actually liable</b> for the underlying claim. The indemnitee <b>must not be a mere volunteer</b> who has settled the underlying claim when there was no exposure to legal liability that obligated him or her to do so; if an indemnitee had no liability for the loss in the inception, then any payment made by the indemnitee is considered purely voluntary and not subject to indemnification.
</p>

<p>
Many courts have recognized <b>an exception to the general rule</b> &#x2026;. This exception applies in cases in which the would-be indemnitor is provided notice of the underlying claim against the indemnitee and <b>declines an opportunity to assume the defense</b>. 
</p>

<p>
But in order for this exception to apply, <b>the party seeking indemnity must still show</b>[:] 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>that it was <i>potentially</i> liable and</li>

<li>that the settlement amount was reasonable in light of that potential liability.</li>
</ul>

<p>
While these rules govern indemnification obligations imposed by law, parties are free to create separate or additional indemnification obligations by agreement. So, for example, parties can, by contract, alter the common law rules on indemnity by calling for indemnification in the absence of underlying liability between the indemnitee and the injured party. <cite> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/nebraska/supreme-court/2023/s-22-147.html">Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. v. McDavid</a>, 313 Neb. 479, 483-84 (2023) (reversing summary judgment in favor of Avis and remanding with instructions to grant summary judgment in favor of car renter) (formatting modified). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-indem-ny-tenant">
<p>
In New York, agreements that purport to <i>exempt</i> landlords from liability for negligence are void under <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GOB/5-321">General Obligations Law § 5-321</a>. Moreover, under that law, "[p]lacing a requirement upon a tenant-lessee to procure insurance does not relieve the landlord of the effects of [that law]." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14127667732297348276">On Point Window Treatment, Inc. v. 208 Clinton Place, LLC</a>, 2024 NY Slip Op 50241 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Mar. 10, 2024) (denying landlord's motion to dismiss). </cite>
</p>

<p>
It's a different story when it comes to <i>indemnification</i> against liability <i>to third parties</i>, backed by insurance (there's that "I&I" thing again; see Protocol <a href="#i-i">16.3.12</a>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; where, as here, <i>the liability is to a third party</i>, General Obligations Law § 5-321 does not preclude enforcement of an <i>indemnification</i> provision in a commercial lease negotiated at arm's length between two sophisticated parties <i>when coupled with an insurance procurement requirement</i>. In such circumstances, the landlord is not <i>exempting</i> itself from liability to the victim for its own negligence. Rather, the parties are <i>allocating</i> the risk of liability <i>to third parties</i> between themselves, essentially through the employment of insurance, and the courts do not, as a general matter, look unfavorably on agreements which, by requiring parties to carry insurance, afford protection to the public. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6006860212351163590">Castano v.

The Fifth Circuit explained in 2022: "The Texas Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act ('TOAIA') voids indemnity agreements that pertain to wells for oil, gas, or water or to mineral mines, unless the indemnity agreement is supported by, <i>inter alia</i>, liability insurance." Moreover, noted the court, under the TOIAA the indemnifying party's liability for indemnity is limited to the dollar amount of insurance that the indemnifying party is contractually <i>required</i> to maintain, even if the indemnifying party happens to maintain more insurance than that. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16340929839143057009">Cimarex Energy Co. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-amend-unil-ill">
<p>
A court might hold that a contract was "illusory" — and thus that <i>the entire contract</i> was unenforceable — if the contract says that a party has the right to change its terms unilaterally and retroactively, at least if the party doesn't give the other party sufficient advance notice and the right to opt out.

<p>
EXAMPLE: A customer sued Blockbuster <i>(remember them?)</i> for allegedly violating the customer's privacy rights; she sought class-action status.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Blockbuster moved to compel <i>individual</i>, case-by-case arbitration, as required in the Blockbuster on-line terms of service.</li>

<li>The customer opposed the motion — doubtless because for her lawyers, many onesie-twosie arbitration proceedings would be <i>much</i> less economically attractive to them than class arbitration would be.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court denied Blockbuster's motion to compel arbitration, on grounds that the company's terms of service were "illusory" — because the unilateral amendment didn't include a so-called <i>Halliburton</i> exception, discussed below — and therefore was unenforceable under the relevant state law. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1302699264380942572">Harris v.

Now think about what else could result from a court's holding about an "illusory" contract: One or both parties might lose protection that the contract might otherwise have provided, such as for example an arbitration clause with class-action waiver; a forum-selection or governing-law clause; a limitation of liability; and so on.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> Parties presumably would always be free to <i>agree</i> to amend the Con&shy;tract with <i>retroactive</i> effect — but then of course it wouldn't be a <i>unilateral</i> amendment &#x2026;.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> A "going forward only" limitation might well save a unilateral-amendment clause from invalidation. EXAMPLE: A court held that an employer had the right to terminate its arbitration agreement with employees, <span class="underline">but</span> the termination would not apply to claims that had accrued before the amendment. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16326955403953755557">Lizalde v. Vista Quality Markets, Inc.</a>, 746 F.3d 222, 224 (5th Cir. 2014) (reversing district court's denial of employer's motion to compel arbitration of employee's claim for on-the-job injury). </cite>
</p>

</p>

<p>
To somewhat-similar effect, the <a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/usa/terms">Uber ride-sharing terms of service</a> of April 4, 2022 (last visited May 13, 2022) states, in the penultimate paragraph of section 1, that amendments by Uber are effective after notice, which <i>arguably</i> implies no retroactive effect:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; Unless Uber says otherwise in its notice, the amended Terms <i>will be effective immediately</i> and your continued access to and use of the Services after Uber provides such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop accessing and using the Services.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Somewhat more-restrictively: A majority of the North Carolina supreme court held that a unilateral-amendment provision in a credit union's terms of service — which the credit union used to add an arbitration requirement — sufficiently complied with the state's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; the unilateral-amendment provision required advance notice and an opportunity to opt out <i>and</i> "the changes <i>[to add arbitration]</i> reasonably relate to subjects discussed and reasonably anticipated in the original agreement." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8031619116429908285">Canteen v. Charlotte Metro Credit Union</a>, 900 S.E.2d 890, 896 (N.C. 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
But two dissenting judges in that case objected that, by unilaterally adding the arbitration provision, the credit union "single-handedly deprived <i>[the customer]</i> of her constitutional right to a jury trial on her claims and the ability to defray the burden of vindicating that right through a class action. To make matters worse, the modification’s language—drafted and adopted by CMCU alone—left <i>[the customer]</i> without an avenue to opt out of arbitration and the class action waiver." But this was a dissent, of course, so the dissenters' views didn't prevail. <cite> <i>Id.</i> at 898 (Riggs, J., dissenting). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<a id="orgac94af0"></a> 
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, an express going-forward limitation would likely forestall an illusoriness argument. EXAMPLE: In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1820576798960453006">Halliburton</a> (Tex. 2002), the Texas supreme court held that an employer could <i>unilaterally</i> impose a change the terms of at-will employment to require arbitration of disputes, <b>as long as</b>: (i) the employer gave advance notice; <b>and</b> (ii) the change didn't apply to claims against the employer where the employer had already been given notice of the claim. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1820576798960453006">In re Halliburton Co.</a>, 80 S.W.3d 566, 569-70 (Tex. 2002); see also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11740761712177887120">Watch House Int'l, LLC v. Nelson</a>, 815 F.3d 190 (5th Cir. 2016) (reversing and remanding order compelling arbitration) (lack of <i>advance</i>-notice requirement rendered unenforceable a unilateral-amendment provision); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16326955403953755557">Lizalde v. Vista Quality Markets</a>, 746 F.3d 222 (5th Cir. 2014), where a federal trial court denied a party's motion to compel arbitration, but an appellate court reversed. </cite>
</p>

<p>
This, incidentally, raises the question whether the unilateral-amendment provision would be enforceable in the <a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/usa/terms">Uber ride-sharing terms of service</a> of April 4, 2022, <a href="#orgef72e9f">reproduced</a> in <a href="#nl-amend-unil-ill">17.1.7.1</a>, because that provision states that unilateral amendments are effective immediately upon notice.

<h5 id="amend-unil-prf"><span class="section-number-5">17.1.7.2.</span> <b>Caution:</b> Be able to "prove up" the <i>fact</i> of notice</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-amend-unil-prf">
<p>
A party that might send out notices of unilateral amendment should consider whether the party's email system and procedures can produce <i>evidence</i> that will persuade a judge or jury that a notice was actually sent to a particular customer, user, etc.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A court vacated an order confirming an arbitration award against a PayPal customer who'd brought a claim against the company. The court remanded for a trial about whether the customer had <i>in fact</i> consented to PayPal's unilateral amendment to its terms of service, which had added an arbitration requirement. This fact issue arose because the customer — by sworn declaration — denied having seen the amended user agreement and claimed never to have received an email about it. As a result, a trial was necessary, so that the fact-finder (presumably a jury) could get to the bottom of the matter. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14452953365097759458">Kass v. PayPal, Inc.</a>, 75 F.4th 693 (7th Cir. 2023). </cite>
</p>

<p>
(DCT comment: What odds would you give that a local jury would side with PayPal on that point?)
</p>

<p>
And this judicial skepticism could persist even through trial. EXAMPLE: A federal court in California ruled that Dropbox had failed to unilaterally amend its terms of service (to add an arbitration requirement). Why? Because, said the court, Dropbox had not <i>shown</i>, by a preponderance of the evidence, that <i>in fact</i> Dropbox had given notice of the amendment, where the user denied having opened or read the notice email that Dropbox sent.
</p>

<p>
(DCT comment: This is an example of how in court, "truth is a happy accident" — what matters is <i>evidence</i>.)
</p>

<p>
The court said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
There is nothing in the record to suggest that Plaintiff could not use the service until he indicated his assent, that he would have been advised of new terms and conditions while using Defendant’s services, or that Defendant ever tracked whether Plaintiff had opened its email. 
</p>

<p>
Even if the email alone could be considered “reasonably conspicuous notice,” Plaintiff took no action to unambiguously manifest his assent…
</p>

<p>
Given the complete lack of evidence of notice within Defendant’s service itself, Plaintiff’s ongoing use of the service is irrelevant to determining whether he had actual or constructive notice of the post-2011 terms of service.
</p>

EXAMPLE: An Uber driver in Georgia murdered one of his passengers. <i>(You think</i> that <i>might have influenced the court's thinking?)</i> The passenger's mother sued Uber for wrongful death. In the Georgia trial court, Uber successfully moved to compel arbitration, but an appellate court reversed and remanded, holding that a triable question existed whether the deceased passenger had <i>in fact</i> received updated terms and conditions from Uber — and thus had implicitly assented to arbitration by continuing to use the Uber service. That's because "neither the affidavit nor the exhibits provided by Uber list the email address to the which email was sent. &#x2026; <b>There is also no record evidence that the email was delivered to Thornton</b>."

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> New York's highest court essentially "blessed" a process that Uber had used to amend its online terms of service to incorporate an arbitration provision — which presumably included Uber's having preserved its electronic records that showed the following:

<h6 id="nl-factoring">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-nl-factoring">
<p>
A.&nbsp; This relates to a form of financing known as "factoring": When a party (the "Biller") is owed money under a contract, it could be that  payment isn't due for a long time, or possibly the payer is seriously past due. If the Biller wants its money sooner, the Biller might "sell," or "factor," the account receivable (i.e., the Biller's right to the future payment) to a third party. This is known as a "<b>pledge</b>" of the receivable; it gives the Biller early access to the money it's owed — for a price.
</p>

<p>
"A factoring agreement allows a business to convert receivables <i>[that is, a right to be paid, e.g., by a customer]</i> into cash by selling them at a discount to a factoring company, providing the business with immediate liquidity." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10167796801157348318&hl=en&as_sdt=6,44">Coosemans Specialties, Inc. v. Gargiulo</a>, 485 F.3d 701, 704 n.1 (2d Cir. 2007) (cleaned up); see also <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factor.asp">Factor</a> (Investopedia.com). </cite>
</p>

<p>
(Generally in factoring of accounts-receivable, the amount that the Biller gets from the third party will be at a discount from the face value of the amount owed; for example, the Biller might sell, for (say) $98, the Biller's contractual right to be paid $100 in three months. The numbers here are fictitious, of course.)
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; It's not unknown for contracts to prohibit pledges. EXAMPLE: Under a commercial lease for restaurant space in downtown Boston, the landlord sold a liquor license to the restaurant operator for $1.00, with a prohibition against the operator's pledging the license. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10325238134799477220">Nicosia v.

A.&nbsp;  Background: In the modern corporate world —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A party to a contract might later want to do <b>a major "corporate" transaction such as a merger or asset sale</b>.</li>

<li>The transaction might well entail "<a href="#assmt-what">assigning</a>" (see <a href="#assmt-what">17.3.7.1</a>) one or more associated contracts.</li>

<li><b>The assigning party might first have to get consent</b> for the transaction from the other party to the contract — and that might be true for multiple contracts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Such a contractual consent requirement could, in effect, give each of those contract counterparties <b>a <i>de facto</i> veto</b> over the assigning party's ability to do the "corporate" transaction.
</p>

<p>
And: If the counterparty were to stall (perhaps in the hope of "extracting" financial- or business concessions), the opportunity for the transaction might disappear as the other party to the transaction grew tired of waiting.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In one high-profile, politically-sensitive case involving a Dubai company, the Port of New York and New Jersey insisted on being paid a $10 million consent fee — <i>plus</i> a commitment to invest another $40 million in improvements to terminal operations — in return for the Port's consent to an assignment of a lease, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/17/nyregion/17dubai.html?_r=1">as reported</a> in the New York Times.
</p>


<p>
EXAMPLE: Tech giant Cisco Systems spun off its video services division, selling the division to a private equity firm; the spun-off division was rebranded as Synamedia. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As part of the transaction, Cisco sold certain assets to Synamedia, which also assumed certain liabilities. (This is not an uncommon approach.)</li>

<li>But there was a problem: One of the assets to be acquired by Synamedia was a 25-year lease in Hampshire, England — and that lease required the landlord's consent to an assignment, which the landlord refused to give.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So Synamedia moved out of the space anyway, and Cisco and Synamedia ended up in litigation over who was responsible for paying the rent. The parties ultimately <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1619137455764142056">settled the lawsuit</a>, but of course they had to incur the expense and business distraction of litigating it. <cite> See <a href="https://casetext.com/case/cisco-sys-v-synamedia-ltd-1">Cisco Sys., Inc. v. Synamedia Ltd.</a>, 557 F. Supp. 3d 464 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (granting in part and denying in part Synamedia's motion to dismiss). (Hat tip: <a href="https://twitter.com/NY_Contracts/status/1439942167636717569">@NYContracts</a>.) </cite>
</p>


<p>
EXAMPLE: Restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday ("Ruby") was the tenant in a lease of a mansion that Ruby used for corporate retreats. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Encountering financial difficulties, Ruby wanted to sell the lease to a real-estate developer, BNA Associates.</li>

<li>But to assign the lease, Ruby needed the consent of one of Ruby's creditors, Goldman Sachs, because of a provision in their credit agreement.</li>

<li>Goldman refused its consent; Ruby lost the deal and ended up in bankruptcy — and <i>Goldman</i> ended up with the lease that the real-estate developer had wanted to buy from Ruby.</li>

<li>The real-estate developer sued Goldman for intentional interference with business relations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Affirming the trial court's order dismissing the case, the Sixth Circuit was equally dismissive: "Goldman was perhaps playing hardball. Any rational actor would likely have done the same, were it in their perceived best interest." <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12692275494974622675">BNA Assoc. LLC v.

<p>
A.&nbsp; <b>Important:</b> In some jurisdictions, the <i>wording</i> of a merger agreement could <i>automatically</i> result in an assignment of assets by operation of law; that could mean that the transaction required consent in the same way as an "assignment." That, in turn, would give the other party considerable leverage, and even a veto, over the assigning party's strategic options — or it could cause other trouble for both the assigning party and the assignee.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In one contract, an anti-assignment clause prohibited a particular party from assigning the contract without consent, whether "by operation of law or otherwise." That particular party was later merged out of existence in a so-called <b>forward</b> triangular merger. A Delaware trial court held that the resulting unauthorized assignment, by operation of law, caused the assigning party, and thus its assignee, to lose the right to certain payments. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10288741485640456789">MTA Canada Royalty Corp. v. Compania Minera Pangea, S.A. de C.V.</a>, No. N19C-11-228, slip op. at text acc. nn.14 et seq. (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 16, 2020) (granting motion to dismiss successor's claim for payment). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> In an earlier case involving a <a href="#nl-rtm">reverse-triangular merger</a> ("RTM"), the state's chancery court had ruled, on summary judgment, that "mergers <i>do not</i> result in an assignment by operation of law of assets <i>that began</i> as property of <i>the surviving entity</i> <i>and continued to be such after the merger</i>," as is the case in an RTM. <cite> <a href="http://courts.delaware.gov/opinions/download.aspx?ID=185600">Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC v. Roche Diagnostics GmbH</a>, 62 A.3d 62 (Del. Ch. 2013) (partial summary judgment; emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In another RTM case, a California appeals court held that "where the form of reorganization was not chosen to disadvantage creditors or shareholders, we will not ignore the form of reorganization chosen by the corporation." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4080119259604512141">North Valley Mall, LLC v. Longs Drug Stores California LLC</a> 27 Cal. App. 5th 598, 600, 238 Cal. Rptr. 3d 368 (2018) (California law).

</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Peripherally: A federal district court in Kansas held that under Delaware law, a merger involving a patent licensee did not result in a contractually-prohibited transfer of the license itself. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3045921812980945456">High Point Sarl v. Sprint Nextel Corp.][High Point Sarl v. Sprint Nextel Corp.</a>, 67 F. Supp. 3d 1294, 1302 (D.

</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Option <a href="#assmt-merger-except">17.3.5.2</a> is worded to allow the Assigner to assign the Con&shy;tract to an <a href="#r-affil-defn">affiliate</a> of the buyer of the Assigner's business. This has in mind that the reverse triangular merger is a common structure for acquisition transactions. The language is inspired in part by the assignment consent exception seen in section 7(a) of a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065696/000119312511118050/dex101.htm">Bank of America contract</a> based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDA_Master_Agreement">ISDA Master Agreement</a>.

<p>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-assmt-cons-no-unrsnbl">
<p>
In some jurisidictions, <i>the law</i> might require that consent to assignment of the agreement must not be unreasonably withheld. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> <a href="http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/1995.260.html">Section 1995.260</a> of the California Civil Code provides that: "If a restriction on transfer of <b>the tenant's interest in a lease</b> requires the landlord's consent for transfer but provides no standard for giving or withholding consent, the restriction on transfer shall be construed to include an implied standard that the landlord's consent may not be unreasonably withheld. &#x2026; " 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Apropos of that statutory provision, a California appeals court held that a contract provision allowing the landlord to withhold consent "for any reason or no reason" was not to be construed as including an unreasonably-withheld standard, saying that "the parties' express agreement to a ‘sole discretion' standard is permitted under legal standards existing before and after enactment of section 1995.260, as long as the provision is freely negotiated and not illegal." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5975088459473960721">Nevada Atlantic Corp. v. Wrec Lido Venture, LLC</a>, No. G039825 (Cal. App. Dec. 8, 2008) (unpublished; reversing trial-court judgment that withholding of consent was unreasonable). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In an Oregon case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A lease prohibited the tenant from assigning the agreement, including by operation of law, without the landlord's consent.</li>

<li>The lease also stated that the landlord would not unreasonably withhold its consent to an assignment of the lease <i>to a subtenant that met certain qualifications</i>.</li>

<li>Notably, though, the lease did <i>not</i> include a similar, no-unreasonable-withholding statement for <i>other</i> assignments.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oregon's supreme court held that ordinarily, the state's law would indeed have required the landlord to act in good faith in deciding whether or not to consent to an assignment. <b>But</b>, the court said, the parties had <i>implicitly</i> agreed otherwise — therefore, the landlord did <i>not</i> have such a duty of good faith. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7064392015529436400">Pacific First Bank v. New Morgan Park Corp.</a>, 876 P.2d 761 (Or. 1994) (affirming court of appeals decision on different grounds, and reversing trial-court declaration that bank-tenant had not <i>materially</i> breached lease). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Eleventh Circuit upheld a trial court's finding that the owner of a patent, which had exclusively licensed the patent to another party, had <i>not</i> acted <i>unreasonably</i> under the circumstances when it refused consent to an assignment by the licensee to a party that wanted to acquire the licensee's relevant product line. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12210349750278162391">MDS (Canada) Inc. v. Rad Source Tech., Inc.</a>, 720 F.3d 833, 850 (11th Cir. 2013), <i>affirming in part</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17538798103636253268">822 F. Supp. 2d 1263</a> (S.D. Fla. 2011). (This holding provides a useful illustration of how appeals courts have only a limited ability to "second-guess" a trial court's findings of fact.) </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Tennessee's supreme court held that:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
where the parties have contracted to allow assignment of an agreement with the consent of the non-assigning party, 
</p>

<p>
and the agreement is silent regarding the anticipated standard of conduct in withholding consent, 
</p>

<p>
[then] an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing applies[,]
</p>

<p>
and requires the nonassigning party to act with good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner[,] in deciding whether to consent to the assignment. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17013430440177580551">Dick Broadcasting Co. v. Oak Ridge FM, Inc.</a>, 395 S.W.3d 653, 656-57 (Tenn. 2013) (affirming vacation of summary judgment and remand to district court) (formatting revised). </cite>e
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Alabama's supreme court alluded to a similar possibility: The contract in suit specifically gave the Shoney's restauraunt chain the right, <i>in its sole discretion</i>, to consent to any proposed assignment or sublease of a ground lease by a real-estate developer that had acquired the ground lease from Shoney's. The supreme court held that this express language overrode a rule that had been laid down in prior case law, namely that a refusal to consent is to be judged by a reasonableness standard under an implied covenant of good faith. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14754343401549936655">Shoney's LLC v. MAC East, LLC</a>, 27 So.3d 1216, 1220-21 (Ala. 2009) (on certification by Eleventh Circuit). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> The Texas supreme court declined to read a reasonableness requirement into an assignment-consent provision — perhaps in part because that a draft of the contract in question had included a "shall not be unreasonably withheld" provision that was deleted and specifically discussed by the parties. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=472849420318702928">Barrow-Shaver Resources Co. v.

</p>

<p>
<b>Caution</b> for Texas lawyers and law students: <i>Barrow-Shaver</i> fits in with Texas's non-recognition of a <i>general</i> implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16602806731795093132">Subaru of America, Inc. v.

<p>
When this Option is agreed to: If the Assigner assigns the Con&shy;tract without a consent required by law or by the Con&shy;tract, THEN: The Assigner is considered to have materially breached the Con&shy;tract.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Material breach: See Protocol<a href="#r-termin-breach">20.6</a>.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; If the Con&shy;tract is silent on this point, it might require a costly trial to determine whether a material breach had occurred. Why might this matter? 
</p>

<p>
First: if the non-assigning party didn't have the right to <i>terminate</i> for material breach, then:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the non-assigning party could be stuck with a new contract partner;</li>

<li>the non-assigning party's only remedy against the assigning party (for assigning without the required consent) would presumably be money damages; and</li>

<li>it might be difficult — and costly — for the non-assigning party to come up with <i>evidence</i> to persuasively establish the fact and the precise amount of damages.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Second: If the non-assigning party did purport to terminate the contract merely because the other party assigned the agreement without consent, that could result in the <i>non-assigning</i> party being liable for wrongful termination. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Fourth Circuit case, something like that happened when —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A party terminated a contract because of an allegedly-unconsented assignment by the other party.</li>

<li>The unconsented assignment was held <i>not</i> to be a <i>material</i> breach.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, said the court, the <i>termination</i> was <i>itself</i> a breach, and so the <i>terminating</i> party was held liable for the resulting damages suffered by the other party. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15576247741045608683">Hess Energy Inc. v.

E.&nbsp; In an oddball case involving a "void without consent" assignment, ExxonMobil found that it was stuck with more than $2 million in pollution-remediation costs for a pipeline easement.

<h5 id="assmt-what"><span class="section-number-5">17.3.7.1.</span> What <i>is</i> an "assignment" of a contract?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-assmt-what">
<p>
In law school, first-year students often learn that when a contract is assigned:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the assignor <i>delegates</i>, to the assignee, responsibility for the assignor's obligations;</li>
<li>the assignor <i>remains liable</i> to the other party for any breach by the assignee; and</li>
<li>the assignee is entitled to the assignor's rights under the contract.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This general rule is reflected in, e.g., <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-210">section 2-210</a> of the Uniform Commercial Code; article 2 of course applies only to the sale of goods, but courts sometimes look to it for guidance in other situations.

<div id="outline-container-assmt-cons-what" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="assmt-cons-what"><span class="section-number-5">17.3.7.2.</span> General rule: <i>Most</i> "ordinary" contracts can be freely assigned</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-assmt-cons-what">
<p>
To promote economic efficiency, <b>the general rule</b> is that — with some exceptions in special cases, discussed in the additional notes beginning at <a href="#assmt-consent-IP-cmt">17.3.7.4</a> below — <b>contracts are assignable <i>without consent</i>.</b>
</p>

<p>
Example: The assignability of contracts is a key feature of "futures" trading in commodities, stocks, currencies, interest rates, and the like. For example, in the case of natural gas, a U.S. Department of Energy Website explains that, "The natural gas futures market is a marketplace where <b>standardized contracts</b> for the future delivery of set natural gas volumes <b>are traded</b>." <cite> U.S. Energy Information Administration, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62605">What is the natural gas futures market?</a> (2024) (emphasis added). </cite>

(For a readable explanation of commodity futures trading, see, e.g., Adam Hayes, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodityfuturescontract.asp">Commodity Futures Contract: Definition, Example, and Trading</a> (Investopedia.com 2022).)
</p>

<p>
Similarly, companies and individuals buy (and/or sell) contracts — namely, standardized "call" and "put" option contracts — for stocks, commodities, and the like, to reduce their financial risk from pricing swings. <cite> See generally, e.g., Casey Murphy, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/sellingoptions.asp">Put Option vs. Call Option: When to Sell</a> (Investopedia 2024). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-assmt-k-state-c">
<p>
A contract can state that one or more specified parties may not "assign" the contract without the other party's consent, even if the law would otherwise allow assignment. This can often happen, for example, when a customer with bargaining power insists that a supplier may not assign a contract for the sale of goods or for services.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sample language:</b>  "Except as clearly stated otherwise in the Con&shy;tract, <i>[fill in the prospective assigning party's name]</i> must not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of <i>[fill in the reviewing party's name]</i>."

(The <i>licensor</i> is presumably free to assign if it wishes.)

<p>
EXAMPLE: A software vendor filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against one of its customers and a third party to which the customer had allegedly assigned its software license without the vendor's permission. At this writing (mid-2025), the litigation has been dragging on since early 2019, with two trips to the Eighth Circuit. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14605817529738863708">LADS Network Solutions, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
A tangential point: Some license agreements prohibit <i>assignment</i> of the license but allow the licensee to <i>sublicense</i> to third parties. That could result in litigation over whether a given transaction by the licensee was a prohibited assignment, or instead was a permitted sublicense. EXAMPLE: Florida's supreme court declined to impose a bright-line rule on this point, noting that the <i>name</i> given to the transaction ("assignment" or "sub&shy;li&shy;cense") would not be determinative. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8019963862214115362">MDS (Canada) Inc. v.

<p>
Another exception to the rule of free assignability is that a party may not assign a contract if the assigning party's performance is considered <i>special or unique</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> For any given contract, the question whether a particular party's performance would fall into this "special or unique performance" category would probably present <i>factual issues</i> that would have to go to <i>trial</i>, as opposed to being adjudicated more quickly and less expensively on the pleadings or on summary judgment.

The Assignment of Contracts Act, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/41/6305">41 U.S.C. § 6305</a>, and the Assignment of Claims Act, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3727">31 U.S.C. § 3727</a>, together make up the “Anti-Assignment Acts.” These Acts generally prohibit the assignment of a government contract or claim. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org94ffc30" class="outline-6 cmtry">
<h6 id="org94ffc30">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org94ffc30">
<p>
In other, non-government context, claims might indeed be assignable without consent; see <a href="#assmt-claims-c">17.3.7.10</a>. </aside>
</p>

<p>
The Acts serve two primary purposes – first, to prevent persons of influence from buying up claims against the United States, which might then be improperly urged upon officers of the Government; and second, to enable the United States to deal exclusively with the original claimant instead of several parties.  
</p>

<p>
Any attempt to transfer a contract in violation of the Assignment of Contracts Act annuls the contract.  A valid transfer subject to that statute requires government approval to be binding against the Government. The Government can recognize an assignment expressly via novation or implicitly by ratification or waiver.
</p>

<p>
Assignments occurring by the “operation of law” (i.e., corporate restructurings, mergers, and name changes “where in essence the contract continues with the same entity, but in a different form”) are exempt from the Act’s application. &#x2026; Courts have applied the exception to statutory mergers, concluding that such assignments do not present the danger that the statute was designed to obviate.

<p>
EXAMPLE: A New York statute provides that, whenever a company enters into a contract with a state agency, the company cannot assign the contract without the agency's consent; if the contractor fails to obtain the consent, the agency "shall revoke and annul such contract," and the contractor forfeits all payments except that needed to pay its employees. <cite> See <a href="http://goo.gl/CavNgZ">N.Y. State Fin. L. art. 9, § 138</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
The non-assignability of state contracts can give the state agency considerable leverage — and in New York, state agencies apparently can be quite unabashed about wielding that leverage, as seen in one noteworthy episode involving the Port of New York and New Jersey and a Dubai company, discussed at <a href="#assmt-asset-except">17.3.5.1</a>.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-AssmtConsCorpForm-c">
<p>
Background: Sometimes a party to a contract will change its organizational form, for example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>by changing from a limited-liability company ("LLC") to a corporation, or vice versa; or</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>by reincorporating in a different state, e.g., "moving" from Delaware to Texas, as Elon Musk's companies <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-delaware-elon-musk-moves-spacex-incorporation-to-texas/">SpaceX</a> and <a href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/tesla-reincorporation-texas-delaware-musk-shareholders/">Tesla</a> did in 2024.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a id="org8c0e2c3"></a> If that contract required the party to obtain consent to an "assignment," would the party breach that consent obligation if it didn't obtain consent to its change of organizational form? The significance of this issue can be seen by a 2024 New York case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The plaintiff was a <i>corporation</i> when it entered into the contract in suit with the defendant, but later the plaintiff changed its corporate form by merging with an LLC.</li>

<li>Importantly, the contract included an assignment-consent requirement: "This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder may not be assigned by either Party, whether by operation of law, <b>merger</b>, change of ownership or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other Party, and any unauthorized assignment shall be void <i>ab initio</i>." <cite> Bold-faced emphasis added; <i>ab initio</i> means, roughly, "from the start."]</li>

<li>The plaintiff sued the defendant for breach of the contract; the defendant moved to dismiss for lack of standing, on grounds that the defendant had entered into the contract with <i>the corporation</i>, not the LLC.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court denied the defendant's motion, holding that "the plaintiff raised a question of fact as to whether the merger constituted an assignment that violated the nonassignment provision of the contract." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11931397779673732361">Whitson’s Food Service, LLC v. A.R.E.B.A.-Casriel, Inc.</a>, 2024 NY Slip Op 04480, 230 A.D.3d 1274, 218 N.Y.S.3d 455 (App. Div.) (affirming denial of motion to dismiss for lack of standing). </cite>

Stiefel Labs., Inc.</a>, 792 F.3d 842, 846 (7th Cir. 2015) (Posner, J.). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> An assignment-consent provision could specifically provide that a change of control does indeed requires consent — but that would likely be objected to by any party with any sort of bargaining power.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> If a contract requires a party's consent for "direct <i>or indirect</i>" assignment by another party, then consent <i>might</i> be required for a sale of stock of the other party resulting in a change of control intended to circumvent a consent requirement. <cite> See Glenn D.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-assmt-consent-chicken-cmt">
<p>
A reviewing party, asked to consent to an assignment of a contract, might be willing to "play chicken" with the assigning party by (metaphorically) folding its arms and saying, in effect: <i>We think we ARE being reasonable in withholding our consent unless you pay us big bucks. If you don't agree, then sue us — and watch your deal evaporate before your eyes while you wait months or years for the court proceedings to end.</i> 
</p>

<p>
(Presumably the reviewing party would never be so incautious as to actually <i>say</i> something like the previous paragraph, because it would look really bad to a judge or jury if it were to be quoted — or misquoted — in court.)

<li>The university grants a license to a startup company that was founded to commercialize the invention.</li>

<li>The license agreement contains terms very favorable to the startup company, such as a low royalty rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In such a situation, the university might not necessarily be willing to have the startup company — and the patent license — to be acquired by a giant corporation in the same field, because the university might not have been willing to give the giant corporation the same low royalty rate.

<p>
In reviewing a request for consent to assignment, a reviewing party should give due consideration to any evidence that the assigning party provides concening the apparent qualifications of the proposed assignee. 
</p>

<p>
But a prospective reviewing party might want to spell out, in the contract, a list of specific safe-harbor factors that could justify withholding consent. For example, in the context of a real-estate lease, "[a] more aggressive landlord will expressly condition its consent <i>[to a tenant's assignment of a lease]</i> on the presence or absence of certain circumstances, such as: (1) the tenant not being in default under the lease &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherinemedianik/">Katherine Medianik</a>, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/permitted-transferees-what-a-commercial-70634/">Permitted Transferees: What a Commercial Tenant Needs to Know When Negotiating the Assignment Clause</a> (JDSupra.com 2020), <a href="https://perma.cc/SC5U-RSB8">https://perma.cc/SC5U-RSB8</a> (items 2 through 7 omitted); see also Robert E.

<div id="outline-container-assmt-in-part-cmt" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="assmt-in-part-cmt"><span class="section-number-5">17.3.7.15.</span> Assignment <i>in part</i> might be desired</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-assmt-in-part-cmt">
<p>
An assigning party might want to assign a contract only "in part" — this would be to support a not-uncommon business practice in which:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A company (the "seller") is licensed to use certain software in its business;</li>

<li>The seller sells an unincorporated division of its business, or a site such as a refinery or a factory;</li>

<li>In connection with the sale, some of the seller's people will change employers, so that after the sale closes, those people will continue in their old jobs, but they'll now be working for the <i>buyer</i>;</li>

<li>Both the seller and the buyer want those people to be able to keep using the software in question — but that might be tricky if the buyer isn't already licensed to use the software.</li>

<li>Moreover, the seller wants to continue using the software in the rest of its business, as before.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For that reason, Option <a href="#assmt-asset-except">17.3.5.1</a> is set up to allow the seller to assign the software license "in part."
</p>

<p>
To be sure: If the software <i>licensor</i> (i.e., the company that makes and licenses the software) had enough bargaining power, then the licensor might demand that the buyer buy its own license to use the software; that could be a nice, incremental chunk of sales revenue for the licensor.
</p>

<p>
But that might well be short-sighted, because the buyer and seller of the business might ask, "Hey, the seller already paid for the license; why should the buyer have to re-buy it?" 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In one case, a software customer (i.e., the licensee) did a corporate reorganization by, in relevant part, a series of mergers.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As a result of the mergers, the <i>named</i> licensee technically became part of a different corporation that was owned by the same parent company — but nothing else had changed.</li>

<li>The software vendor demanded that the customer re-buy the license; the customer refused.</li>

<li>The software vendor took the customer to court — and won. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9776428223016447299">Cincom Sys., Inc. v. Novelis Corp.</a>, 581 F.3d 431 (6th Cir. 2009) (affirming summary judgment in favor of software vendor). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
Editorial comment: That software vendor might have been extremely short-sighted.  Look at it from a <i>sales</i> perspective: When a vendor treats a customer that way, what are the odds that the vendor will <i>ever</i> be able to sell <i>anything</i> again to that customer — let alone convince the customer to serve as a favorable reference to other potential customers? Talk about pennywise and pound-foolish &#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, a <i>smart</i> software licensor will want to agree even to just a <i>partial</i> assignment of the software license. Why? Because the <i>people</i> in the seller's spun-off division — who're now working for the buyer — could serve as unofficial ambassadors for the software licensor, encouraging their new employer to acquire more licenses to use the software elsewhere in the new employer's organization.
</p>

<p>
Failure to get such partial assignments could lead to major litigation. EXAMPLE: Allstate spun off a line of business (for $2 billion). The spun-out business continued to use software that Allstate had previously licensed from a vendor. The vendor promptly sued Allstate and others for $80 million, alleging direct and indirect copyright infringement. <cite> See Stephen Gillespie, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/use-of-software-by-divested-business-7036858">Use of Software by Divested Business After Spinout Brings $80,000,000 Lawsuit</a>. </cite>

<p>
When a contractor enters into an agreement with an owner (for example, a construction contract to build a building), the owner's <i>lender</i> might ask the contractor to sign an agreement that includes — possibly among other burdens — the contractor's <i>obligation</i> to assign the contract to the lender in certain circumstances.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
While the content of these agreements differs from lender to lender, here’s what they normally contain:
</p>

<p>
A.&nbsp; A contractor consent to a potential assignment of the prime contract to the lender in the event the owner defaults;
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The circumstances under which the contractor will or will not get paid for past and future work;
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; A waiver of lien rights for work in place; and D.&nbsp; Obligation on the contractor to seek prior written permission directly from the lender, during the project, and prior to any possible default by the owner, for any change in the plans, the schedule, and even any change orders. <cite> David Taylor, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/prime-contractor-beware-no-1-watch-out-3264399">Prime Contractor Beware, No. 1: Watch Out for Owner/Lender Consent and Assignment Agreements</a> (JDSupra.com 2022). </cite>

<li>the Con&shy;tract calls for Painter to paint Customer's factory interior, <span class="underline">and</span> for Customer to indemnify Painter in respect to any injuries that Painter's employees might suffer on the job that are caused by Customer's own people or machinery;</li>

<li>Customer pays Painter in full, in advance;</li>

<li>But Painter hear rumors that Customer might be having financial difficulties, so Painter wonders whether Customer is "good for" its indemnity obligation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that situation — because Painter has already been paid in full — it's <i>likely</i> only fair that Painter do the paint job, instead of stopping work just because someday Customer <span class="underline">might</span> not be able to meet its indemnity obligations in a scenario that might never actually arise.

On the other hand: If the painting work would be taking place where Customer's people or machinery really could injure Painter's people, then Painter might well be justified in asking for assurance under this Protocol.

(Alternatively, since "only money" is involved for Customer's indemnity obligation, Painter might try to negotiate to have Customer buy insurance (see <a href="#nl-insurance-notes">28.24</a>) or establish some other backup payment source (see Protocol <a href="#r-pmt-sec-addl">9.2</a>).

The "sole discretion" language is intended to forestall any claim that a decision to opt out must comply with any kind of duty of good faith and/or fair dealing. The Supreme Court of Canada once surveyed U.S. cases on this point in its 2015 <i>Bhasin</i> opinion. <cite> See <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14438/index.do">Bhasin v.

<p>
Eligible Party: To exercise the Evergreen Option, give notice to that effect, to all other parties, in accordance with Protocol <a href="#r-notices-rule">2.8</a> — and do it so that the notice becomes effective no later than <span class="v">one month before</span> the then-current expiration date of the Evergreen Period.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Who can exercise: Often, a party with bargaining power (e.g., a big customer dealing with a smaller supplier) will want to be the only one that has the right to exercise the Evergreen Option.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> In some cases a statute might impose a minimum opt-out notice period  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Example:</i> A Minnesota statute, <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325E.37">Minn. Stat. § 325E.37</a> § 3, requires at least 90 days' advance notice of non-renewal of certain sales-representative agreements.</li>

<li><i>Example:</i> In the UK, specific requirements apply to subscription contracts with consumers. <cite> See generally Micaela Bostrom and Michiko Jo, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-uk-s-new-requirements-for-4000119/">The UK’s new requirements for subscription contracts with consumers – DMCC Bill Deep Dive Part 3</a> (JDSupra.com 2023). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> Some parties might want to negotiate the exercise deadline to take into account the circumstances — for example, if it would take a party some time to find and spin up a replacement contract relationship.

Subdivision 2: This Protocol sometimes uses the term <i>renew</i> as a common business vernacular — but in some jurisdictions, a "renewal" right <i>might</i> require a party to renegotiate the terms and conditions as a condition of being able to exercise an option to renew.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In the Eighth Circuit's 2012 <i>AMC Showplace</i> case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The AMC movie theater chain's option to extend its lease of space in a Minnesota shopping center was <i>literally</i> labeled "Option to Extend," and "on the same terms and conditions" except for certain rent adjustments.</li>
<li>The court, though, held that this was really an option to <i>renew</i> — and that under state-court precedent, this in turn gave the landlord the right to demand new terms.</li>
<li>This, said the court, was "because the terms of the option peri</li>

In many long-term business arrangements, the parties want regular opportunities to reevaluate whether to continue the arrangement — <b>but</b> they also want the arrangement to continue as before if no one wants to change it.  By adopting this Protocol in the Con&shy;tract, drafters can provide such an opportunity, on either an opt-out or opt-in basis.

<b>Caution:</b> By law, some jurisdictions restrict automatic <b>extension</b> or <b>renewal</b> of certain contracts (often consumer-facing) unless specific notice requirements are met — for example, a New York statute, <a href="https://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=S01475&term=2019&Text=Y">NY Gen.

In Massachusetts, a commercial tenant found itself owing more than $800,000 in liquidated damages under the tenant's lease with its landlord:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The lease had an automatic-extension provision, with a stated time limit for the tenant to opt out of an extension by notice to the landlord.</li>

<li>The tenant had email- and oral discussions with the landlord about opting out the automatic extension, but "never gave definitive written notice . . . or even clear oral notice" that the tenant was opting out. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2898607786926533795">Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.

Performance-improvement plans are usually seen in employment relationships, but they're not unknown in ongoing business-to-business ("B2B") relationships. This Protocol serves as a framework for developing and implementing a PIP that has at least a decent chance of success — defined as, the employee or supplier not getting fired.

<p>
For an employee or channel partner, "being put on plan" is decidedly Not A Good Thing: In the workplace, it's generally regarded as a tacit signal that the employee is going to be fired, with the company hoping to make itself bulletproof against a subsequent lawsuit by the employee.
</p>

<p>
&bull;  Writing at Forbes.com in 2018, an experienced HR executive said: "a manager only puts you on a Performance Improvement Plan when they want to get rid of you. Instead of a Performance Improvement Plan, it should be called This is the First Step Toward Firing You Plan, because that is what's happening." <cite> Liz Ryan, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2016/04/08/the-truth-about-performance-improvement-plans/">The Truth About 'Performance Improvement Plans'</a> (Forbes.com 2016). </cite>

&bull;  Another writer — not entirely convincingly — was more optimistic : "While the seriousness of them shouldn’t be ignored, if you are put on a PIP, know that all hope is not lost.

Under the law in many jurisdictions, some vendors, service providers, and others are <b>deemed</b> to implicitly "warrant" certain things (see the discussion at <a href="#nl-impl-warr-discl">18.1.6</a>). Many of those implied warranties can be "disclaimed" — that is, negated by a statement saying, in effect, <i>no, we're <b>not</b> warranting that particular thing</i>.

In the U.S., article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (adopted in all states except Louisiana) provides a number of <i>implied</i> warranties that sellers are deemed to make when they sell "goods," namely the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>an implied warranty of clean <b>title</b>, "free from any security interest or other lien or encumbrance of which the buyer at the time of contracting has no knowledge," under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-312">UCC § 2-312(1)</a>;</li>

<li>an implied warranty of <b>noninfringement</b> of third-party rights, under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-312">UCC § 2-312(3)</a> —

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>but only if the seller is "a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind";</li>

<li>and with an exception if the buyer furnishes specifications and the infringement;</li>
</ul></li>

<li>an implied warranty of <b>merchantability</b>, under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-314">UCC § 2-314</a>, with a definition that could be paraphrased as, in essence, goods that a reputable merchant would be willing to offer to the public under the contract description; and</li>

<li>an implied warranty of <b>fitness for the buyer's particular purpose</b>, under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-315">UCC § 2-315</a>, but only if "the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods &#x2026;."; whether this prerequisite was met, of course, could be a disputed fact issue, resulting in expensive litigation.</li>

<p>
In the (U.S.) Uniform Commercial Code, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-316">section 2-316</a> (governing sales of goods) specifically allows sellers to disclaim warranties that are not expressly stated in the contract, with some limits:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
(2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of <b>merchantability</b> or any part of it the language must mention merchantability 
</p>

<p>
and in case of a writing must be <b>conspicuous</b>, 
</p>

<p>
and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of <b>fitness</b> the exclusion must be by <b>a writing <i>and</i> conspicuous</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is <b>sufficient</b> if it states, for example, that "There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof."
</p>

<p>
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2)
</p>

<p>
(a) unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, <b>all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is", "with all faults" or other language</b> which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty; and
</p>

<p>
(b) when the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him; and
</p>

<p>
(c) an implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade.

<h5 id="serv-impl-warr-perf"><span class="section-number-5">18.1.6.3.</span> Will there be an implied warranty of <i>workmanlike performance</i>?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-serv-impl-warr-perf">
<p>
Where services are concerned, drafters should be aware that — in <i>some</i> states, in <i>some</i> circumstances — the law might <i>automatically impose</i> a warranty of "<a href="#r-wkmn-defn">workmanlike</a>" performance (see the definition at Protocol <a href="#r-wkmn-defn">26.8</a>) or something close to it. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8340284022802305136">Fed. Ins. Co. v. Winter</a>, 354 S.W.3d 287, 291-94 (Tenn. 2011) (citing numerous authorities but not defining <i>workmanlike</i>). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Implied warranties of workmanlike performance will typically come into play especially in connection with the sale of a new residence. The imposed warranty might even be non-waivable and/or non-disclaimable. For example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Home construction:</i> Forty-three states provide an implied warranty of habitability for new residences, according to a decision by Utah's supreme court, while three other states provide a warranty of workmanlike manner. <cite> See generally <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ut-supreme-court/1482187.html">Davencourt at Pilgrims Landing Homeowners Association v. Davencourt at Pilgrims Landing LC 30</a>, 2009 Utah 65, 221 P.3d 234, 250 (reversing dismissal of implied-warranty claim; "in every contract for the sale of a new residence, a vendor in the business of building or selling such residences makes an implied warranty to the vendee that the residence is constructed in a workmanlike manner and fit for habitation"). </cite></li>

<li><i>Repairs of tangible goods or property:</i> In its <i>Melody Homes</i> decision, the Texas supreme court held that an implied warranty of good and workmanlike performance extends to repairs of tangible goods or property. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17126687559521918562">Melody Home Mfg.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-reps-as-warr">
<p>
Suppose that in a contract <i>for the sale of goods</i> in the U.S., the seller only <i>represents</i> that Fact X is true, without using the word <i>warranty</i>: That representation can itself be a warranty, because under UCC <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-313">§ 2-313(1)</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
(a) <i>Any affirmation of fact</i> or promise made by the seller to the buyer
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>which relates to the goods</li>
<li>and becomes part of <i>the basis of the bargain</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.
</p>

<p>
(b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.
</p>

<p>
(c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Emphasis and extra paragraphing added.) 
</p>

<p>
Of course, it might be hotly disputed whether "the basis of the bargain" included a particular affirmation of fact, description of the goods, or sample or model.
</p>

<p>
Because the representation is (putatively) an <i>express</i> warranty, it likely can't be "disclaimed" as such (but see <a href="#rel-waiver-cmtry">22.34.6.5</a> concerning waivers of reliance on representations).

Courts seem to have more sympathy for a reliance disclaimer if, in the words of the Second Circuit, the disclaimer "tracks the substance of the alleged misrepresentation." The court reversed a lower court's dismissal of a claim under federal securities law, but the underlying principle might well apply in contract cases as well. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8688505243253106236">Caiola v. Citibank, NA</a>, 295 F.3d 312, 330 (2d Cir. 2002) (reversing dismissal of claim under federal securities law) (citing cases). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-RelDisclInitial">
<p>
If there's a concern that a party might someday try to repudiate its reliance disclaimer, it can't hurt to have that party separately initial the contract as close as possible to the disclaimer.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a New York case, an estranged married couple reconciled — temporarily, as it turned out. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>During their reconciliation, the wife voluntarily dismissed her three pending lawsuits against the husband, and they signed a settlement agreement to that effect.</li>

<li>But then the couple separated again, and the wife sued the husband again, this time claiming that he had fraudulently induced her to dismiss her other lawsuits by promising that he would return to her and permanently resume their marital relationship.</li>

<li>Unfortunately for the wife, the settlement agreement she signed included a reliance disclaimer, which she had specifically initialed; as the court acidly noted: "There is no allegation in the complaint that plaintiff did not read or did not understand the agreement; <i>in fact, she initialed the agreement in the margin opposite the very paragraph disclaiming the alleged representation</i>." <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3796991203947035104">Cohen v. Cohen</a>, 1 A.D.2d 586 (N.Y. App. Div. 1956) (per curiam; affirming dismissal of complaint for insufficiency) (emphasis added). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> If a line is provided for a party to initial a reliance disclaimer (or any other specific term), counsel for the other party should <i>make sure that the disclaiming party actually does initial the line</i>. Otherwise, the other party might have an even worse problem: the uninitialed line could help persuade a judge or jury that the allegedly-disclaiming party really did overlook the disclaimer; that's just the opposite of what the other party wanted.

Some states do not allow companies to sell consumer products "as is"; in those states, sellers have implied-warranty obligations that cannot be avoided. And the federal <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law">Magnuson-Moss Act</a> prohibits a company from disclaiming <i>implied</i> warranties (see <a href="#impl-warr-goods">18.1.6.1</a>) for any consumer product <b>if</b> the company offers a <i>written</i> warranty for the product <b>or</b> sells a service contract for it.

<p>
When parties do business together, each party generally presupposes that certain things were true in the past, or are true now, or will be true at some point in the future. But sometimes those presuppositions turn out to be wrong.
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, it's often prudent for parties to divide up <i>the responsibility for making sure</i> that specified things were — or are — or will be — as planned. This can include provisions for parties <i>representing</i> certain things and/or <i>warranting</i> certain things, as discussed in this chapter. 
</p>

<p>
Each <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">representation or warranty</a> basically does two things:
</p>

<p>
Let's consider a hypothetical example: Ginger wants to sell her car to Fred; suppose that she <i>represents</i> — or perhaps warrants, or perhaps both — that her car has never been in an accident <i>[past fact]</i> and is in good working order <i>[present fact]</i>. 
</p>

<p>
But now suppose that after Fred takes delivery of the car and drives it, he learns that it has significant mechanical problems, and he wants to sue Ginger (probably in small-claims court) for damages.
</p>

<p>
To help visualize how this works, think in terms of the American Ninja Warrior TV show, with an evidentiary “Hill of Proof” (see above) that plaintiff Fred must "climb" in making his claim(s) against defendant Ginger: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  As plaintiff, Fred starts out at the bottom of the Hill of Proof.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  As Fred clambers up the Hill of Proof, he tries to "hit" various evidentiary checkpoints along the way.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The “prizes,” i.e., the remedies available to Fred, are positioned at different points up the hill.
</p>

<p>
(“The Hill of Proof” sounds like something from a Harry Potter novel, no?)
</p>

<p>
This is simply a visual depiction of how the law generally works.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-reps-alice-bob-warr">
<p>
Suppose that our defendant Ginger only <i>warranted</i> a fact, but she did not <i>represent</i> it. For example, suppose that Ginger sold her car to plaintiff Fred, and she <i>suspected</i> — but she didn’t know for sure — that the engine was going to need work. 
</p>

<p>
In that case, Ginger might:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>warrant, <i>but not represent</i>, that the car was in good working order, and</li>

<li>limit plaintiff Fred's remedy to defendant Ginger’s reimbursing Fred for up to, say, $200 in repair costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that situation, at trial the only three evidentiary checkpoints that plaintiff Fred would need to reach would be the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>that defendant Ginger <i>warranted</i> a statement of past or present fact, to use Tina Stark’s formulation <i>[I’ll leave out future facts for now]</i>. — here, Ginger’s statement is “the car is in good working order”;</li>

<li>that Ginger's statement was false — her car, as delivered to Fred, turned out to need some significant work; and</li>

<li>that Fred incurred damages as a result, i.e., repair costs.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If, at the trial, plaintiff Fred can successfully get past those three evidentiary checkpoints, then he will be entitled to recover warranty damages (generally, benefit-of-the-bargain damages) for defendant Ginger's breach of warranty — but in this case, <i>limited by the contract</i> to $200 in repair costs.
</p>

<p>
And that’s it; without more, Fred needn't prove that he reasonably relied on Ginger's warranty — but neither will he be entitled to tort-like remedies for fraudulent inducement or negligent misrepresentation, such punitive damages and/or rescission, i.e., unwinding the contract, as he would on the left side of the Hill.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-reps-alice-bob-rep">
<p>
Let’s change up the hypothetical once more: Suppose that Ginger had no reason to think her car had any problems, <i>but</i> she also didn’t want to bear any risk that it did have problems. In that case, Ginger might represent, <i>but not warrant</i>, something like the following: "So far as I know, the car is in good working order, but I'm not a mechanic and I haven't had it checked out by a mechanic."
</p>

<p>
In that situation, if the car did turn out to have problems, then plaintiff Fred would have to hit <i>all five</i> checkpoints on the Hill of Proof (<a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>) to recover <b>any</b> damages from defendant Ginger; the first three alone wouldn't be enough because Ginger <b>didn't warrant</b> that the car was in good condition — even though the first three would be enough if Ginger <i>had/</i> warranted good condition.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-reps-alice-bob-rep-warr">
<p>
But now suppose that defendant Ginger both represented <b>and</b> warranted the statement of fact, i.e., that her car was in good working order. And then suppose that plaintiff Fred successfully hits the first three evidentiary checkpoints on the Hill of Proof (<a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>). In that situation, Fred can try to keep going to hit two more checkpoints, namely:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="4">that Fred in fact <b>relied</b> on Ginger's representation and that Ginger <b>intended</b> for Fred to do so — chances are good that both of these will be practically a given, because why else would Fred's representation have been expressly set forth in the contract that Ginger signed; and</li>

<li>that Ginger made the false representation <b>intentionally</b> (or possibly, in some jurisdictions, was negligent or reckless in doing so). This <b>scienter</b> element is often the biggie, from a proof perspective.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If plaintiff Fred can successfully hit both of <i>these</i> additional evidentiary checkpoints on the Hill of Proof (and if defendant Ginger fails to show that Fred's reliance on her representation was unreasonable), then Fred would be additionally entitled to more “prizes,” namely tort-like remedies such as rescission and perhaps punitive damages.
</p>

<p>
(Defendant Ginger might try to prove that Fred's reliance was unreasonable under the circumstances, which <i>could</i> defeat Fred's misrepresentation claim — but that might be a risky strategy.)
</p>

<p>
At trial, plaintiff Fred might well assert both breach of warranty <i>and</i> fraudulent inducement or negligent misrepresentation. That way, if Fred proves unable to show scienter on defendant Ginger's part, then he can still fall back on his warranty claim. 
</p>

<p>
The same would be true if Ginger could persuade the factfinder that Fred's reliance on her (mis)representation was unreasonable: Fred would lose on his claim for fraudulent inducement or negligent misrepresentation, but he might still be able to win on his warranty claim.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-FraudClaimTheyLied">
<p>
So, here's a rule of thumb:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A party that is <i>asked to</i> represent or warrant something (such as a seller) will always want to consider whether only to <i>warrant</i> the thing or only to <i>represent</i> it; this might well vary depending on the party's actual knowledge and the potential financial exposure if the represented- or warranted thing turns out not to be true.</li>

<li>In contrast, any party <i>asking for</i> a representation or warranty (such as a buyer) will always want to push for <i>both</i> a representation <i>and</i> a warranty, so as to give that party more flexibility in litigation — see the two sides of the Hill of Proof at <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a> — in case the represented- or warranted thing turns out to be false.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This suggests the following strategy for drafting with a future trial in mind:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
If a party "P" is being asked to represent <i>and</i> warrant some fact — say, if P is a supplier being asked for a commitment about its products or services — then a drafter representing P should consider whether P should try to only <i>represent</i> the fact or to <i>warrant</i> the fact. 
</p>

<p>
(As a matter of <i>negotiation</i> strategy P might eventualy end up agreeing to do both. But as a drafter, it’s worth giving some thought to the question.
</p></li>

<li><p>
On the other hand, if <i>your</i> client is asking <i>someone else</i> to represent and warrant a fact — say, if you're a customer asking for a commitment from a supplier — then you’ll want to ask for the contract language to include both a representation <i>and</i> a warranty. 
</p>

<p>
(Argon might not have the bargaining power to insist on getting both — but if it does, then having both could give the client more flexibility if litigation should ever come to pass.)
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Why would a customer ask <i>for</i> both a representation and a warranty? Because "they lied!" is a stinging charge, as discussed at <a href="#RelDisclBkgd">22.34.6.7</a> — and when a big contract fails, trial counsel will pretty much always try hard to find opportunities to accuse the other side of having misrepresented facts. Doing so can work, sometimes spectacularly well: Jurors and even judges might not understand the nuances of the dispute, but they will definitely undertand the accusation that "they lied!"

From <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14782583318811925352">Wright v. Eugene & Agnes E. Meyer Foundation</a>, 68 F.4th 612 (D.C. Cir. May 23, 2023) (lightly edited for formatting):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
WILKINS, Circuit Judge: 
</p>

<p>
Plaintiff Dr. Terri Wright is the former Vice President of Program and Community of the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation, a non-profit that promotes social and racial equity in the Washington D.C. area. In that role, Wright was responsible for the Foundation’s community engagement efforts, grant-making, and collective action strategy. 
</p>

<p>
She received largely positive feedback during her tenure, but less than two years after she was hired, the CEO of the Foundation, Nicola Goren, fired her for purported interpersonal and communication-related issues. Wright, who is African-American, believes these stated reasons were pretext to mask discriminatory animus. 
</p>

<p>
Seeking to avoid litigation, Wright and the Foundation signed a severance agreement, under which Wright agreed to release employment-related claims against the Foundation and its employees, and which contained a mutual non-disparagement clause.
</p>

<p>
But roughly a month after Wright was fired, Goren told another leader in the non-profit space that Wright was let go because she was “toxic,” created a “negative environment,” and that two-thirds of the Foundation staff would have quit if Wright had stayed.
</p>

<p>
Wright sued the Foundation and Goren for breaching the severance agreement, for doing so in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and for defaming her.
</p>

<p>
The District Court dismissed all three claims. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>It first found that the non-disparagement clause obligated the Foundation only to direct its employees not to disparage Wright, leaving the Foundation and its officers and employees free to in fact disparage her</b>.</li>

<li>Second, and as a result, the District Court found that Wright’s § 1981 claim failed because it was based on a breach of the severance agreement.</li>

<li>Lastly, the District Court found that Goren’s statements were protected by the common interest privilege, as they were made in her capacity as the Chair of the Board of a separate non-profit organization to the CEO of that organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>We hold that the District Court erred in dismissing all three claims</b>. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As to Wright’s breach of contract claim, <b>the non-disparagement clause could reasonably be interpreted to preclude the Foundation from disparaging Wright</b>, and dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) <i>[for failure to state a claim even if all pleaded facts are assumed to be true]</i> is therefore inappropriate.</li>

<li>As to her § 1981 claim, we find that she has plausibly alleged a prima facie case that the Foundation, through Goren, breached the severance agreement due to racial animus.</li>

<li>And lastly, because Wright has plausibly alleged that Goren’s statements were made with reckless disregard for the truth and for discriminatory reasons, they are not protected by the common interest privilege, which requires a showing of good faith on the part of the speaker.</li>
</ul>

<p>
* * * 
</p>

<p>
The crux of Wright’s claim is that implicit in the Foundation’s promise to “direct” certain officers, directors, and employees to not disparage her was a promise that <b>the Foundation itself would also not disparage her</b>, at least through the statements of its CEO and President who signed the Agreement. 
</p>

<p>
Thus, Wright argues, the Foundation breached the Severance Agreement when Goren disparaged her in her conversation with Dr. Henson.
</p>

<p>
In Defendants’ view, the Foundation’s duty began and ended with its promise to “direct” its employees; neither the Foundation, nor its directors or any other employee, had a corresponding or continuing duty to not disparage Wright.
</p>

<p>
We find that the Severance Agreement, read as a whole, is ambiguous and reasonably capable of Wright’s interpretation.

<p>
A.&nbsp; This uses the vague-but-practical standard of commercial reasonableness — not least because it gives the Vendor an incentive to err on the side of being clearly "in the band" for that standard.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; This Protocol is designed for general usage, so for convenience, we use the defined term <i>Vendor</i> because it's commonly a service provider that is asked to run background checks on its people. But other types of contracting party might be asked to have background checks run on its people as well. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Example: A manufacturer or distributor of potentially-dangerous software or other critical goods might also be asked to run background checks on its relevant people.</li>

<li>Example: For a party whose people will have access to another party's trade secrets, the other party might want to restrict access to individuals who have had background checks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Depending on the circumstances, parties might agree that some or all of the following should be checked in connection with a background check:
</p>

<p>
1.  Driving-record check: A check of records of accidents; driver's-license status; driver's-license suspensions or revocations; traffic violations; and driving-related criminal charges (e.g., DUI).
</p>

<p>
2.  Education verification: Confirmation of dates of attendance, fields of study, and degrees earned. Education checks are sometimes used because résumé padding is not an uncommon occurrence. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2758348/Walmart-s-chief-spokesman-fired-retail-giant-discovers-lied-resume-graduating-college.html#ixzz47zUcoO2q">The chief spokesman of Walmart resigned</a> after the retail giant learned that he had falsely claimed to have graduated from college, when in fact he had not finished his course work; ditto <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/03/08/391610430/learning-the-hard-truth-about-lying">the former dean of admissions at MIT</a>. 
</p>

<p>
3.  Employment verification: A check of of start- and stop dates and titles of employment for the past <span class="v">seven years</span> or the past <span class="v">two to five</span> employers, whichever results in more  employers being checked.
</p>

<p>
4.  Liens: A check of records of tax- and other liens; civil judgments; and bankruptcy filings (to provide a better indication of any past financial difficulties of the checked individual).
</p>

<p>
5.  Personal reference check:  Telephone- or in-person interviews with at least <span class="v">three</span> personal references, seeking information about the following characteristics of the individual:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ethics;</li>
<li>work ethic;</li>
<li>reliability;</li>
<li>ability to work with others (including, for example and where relevant, peers, subordinates, superiors, customers, and suppliers);</li>
<li>strengths;</li>
<li>areas with room for improvement;</li>
<li>personality.</li>
</ul>

<p>
6.  Professional license verification: Verification that an individual who claims to have a professional license (e.g., doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc.):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>does in fact have such a license; and</li>

<li>is in good standing with the relevant licensing body — because it's not impossible that someone <i>claiming</i> to be a doctor, lawyer, CPA, etc., might not be in good standing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
7.  Residence address verification: A check of dates of residence addresses for the past <span class="v">seven years</span> (to reduce the risk of the checked individual's seeking to evade a criminal-records check by omitting a residence address).

<li>any felony;</li>

<li>violence of any kind, including but not limited to sexual violence;</li>

<h6 id="org27900bd">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org27900bd">
<p>
A.&nbsp; A criminal-history <i>check</i> would typically include a nationwide check of records of arrests, convictions, incarcerations, and sex-offender status.  B.&nbsp; Criminal-history records checks in basic form seem to be available from any number of Web sites at low cost, including from government agencies such as the <a href="https://www.edo.cjis.gov">FBI</a> and/or the <a href="https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/DpsWebsite/CriminalHistory/">Texas Department of Public Safety</a>. 
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: This definition doesn't require a criminal <i>conviction</i>; see the discussion of this subject in the commentary to §  <a href="#bkgd-prohib-crit">19.5.9</a>, which imposes staffing restrictions when a criminal-history concern is revealed.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> Drafters could consider whether to require that subjects of background checks must be asked to submit fingerprints to confirm their identity (and guard against imposters). 
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Under pre-Trump administrations, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed lawsuits against employers who allegedly "violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by implementing and utilizing a criminal background policy that resulted in employees being fired and others being screened out for employment &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-files-suit-against-two-employers-use-criminal-background-checks">EEOC Press Release</a> (2013). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The EEOC also took the position that a blanket prohibition against using personnel with criminal records could be alleged to have a disproportionate impact on racial- or ethnic minorities and thus to be illegal in the United States. <cite>  See <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-consideration-arrest-and-conviction-records-employment-decisions">EEOC Enforcement Guidance</a> (2012). 
</p>

<p>
But the second Trump administration has been taking a chainsaw to DEI programs ("diversity, equity, and inclusion"), so drafters and their counsel should check the latest developments. 
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Entirely aside from the federal government's shifting position, some states — and even some cities — might likewise restrict an employer's ability to rely on criminal background information in making employment-related decisions.
</p>

<p>
Drafters should pay particular attention to the law in California, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Pennsylvania (not necessarily an exhaustive list). This is because in recent years the practice of <i>automatically</i> disqualifying people with criminal convictions has come under fire from government regulators and the plaintiff's bar as being potentially discriminatory (the so-called <a href="http://www.nelp.org/publication/ban-the-box-fair-chance-hiring-state-and-local-guide/">"ban the box" movement</a>).
</p>

<li>illegal drugs;</li>

<li>alcoholic beverages to excess; and/or</li>

<li>prescription drugs other than in accordance with a lawfully-issued prescription.</li>

<h6 id="org7f86dd5">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org7f86dd5">
<p>
A.&nbsp;  These definitions are pretty broad, because if a background check indicates that a person might have a drug-misuse problem — or even took certain prescription medications — then tighter restrictions could appropriate for certain activities.  (This is an area where contract terms might need to be fine-tuned to fit the parties' needs.) </aside>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; As with the definition of <a href="#bkgd-chk-crim-defn">Criminal History</a>, this definition of <i>Drug Concern</i> in Protocol <a href="#bkgd-drug-defn">19.5.5</a> uses the term <i>not-insubstantial evidence</i> instead of <i>substantial evidence</i> because the latter term (1) is more vague, and (2) might be less-recognizable to non-lawyer readers, than the former term. </aside>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Companies should be cognizant of disability laws such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>, which might affect a company's ability to deny employment because of <i>medically-prescribed</i> drug use.  
</p>

<p>
And companies might want to consider the possible effect on employee morale of asking them to take a drug test — and what they might have to do if a valued employee were to bust the test. (As the saying goes: Be careful about asking a question if you're not prepared to deal with the answer.)

C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> If an FCRA consent form contains <b>anything other than</b> the mandated disclosure — <i>even in a footnote</i> — the requester is in danger of being labeled a <i>willful</i> violator, with consequences as stated just above. EXAMPLE: A California appeals court reversed a summary judgment in favor of Barnes & Noble, on grounds that a reasonable jury <i>could</i> find that the company acted willfully by asking a job applicant to sign a consent form provided by a background-checking company, because the consent form included a footnote with a disclaimer of warranties and advice to employers to seek their own legal advice. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15317152204604993273">Hebert v.

It might be prudent to obtain a checked individual's consent to a background check even if the law <i>doesn't</i> require consent: If the individual were to learn of an unconsented background check, the individual's displeasure might go viral on social media, especially given today's heightened sensitivity to privacy concerns.

It's been suggested that background checks on people who have lived in California might not provide employers with much real-world benefit, that that the time and money might be better spent on searching applicants' social media.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nonsol-ptys">
<p>
This Protocol concerns parties to the Con&shy;tract, referred to respectively as the "<b>Protected Party</b>" — whose specified employees are "off limits" as stated below — and the "<b>Obligated Party</b>" clearly identified as such in the Con&shy;tract.
</p>

<p>
A.&nbsp; Drafting suggestion: In the Con&shy;tract, explicitly state which party is which.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The business context: A party to a contract might worry that another party to a contract could try to "poach" the first party's employees who knew the first party's trade secrets. EXAMPLE: That was an issue in a dispute that led to  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15140901534735957730">Syntel Sterling</a> (2d Cir. 2023).  The first party therefore might want the other party to commit to not doing so — especially after the contract expires or is terminated. 
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Nonsolicitation covenants of all stripes can be problematic and even dangerous; this is one area where it's important to check the law of the relevant jurisdiction. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15140901534735957730">Syntel Sterling Best Shores Mauritius Ltd. v.

Survival clauses can be important to parties; here are a couple of examples:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Parties have seen their trade-secret rights in confidential information be destroyed when their confidentiality agreements (a.k.a. "NDAs") expired and did not provide for the recipients' confidentiality obligations to continue in effect (see <a href="#conf-info-expir">11.3.5</a>).</li>

<li>If a contract allows a party to audit another party's books, termination or expiration of the contract could immediately mean no more audits — not even for transactions that occurred during the term of the contract.

<i>The following is adapted — cleaned up and with very-light format editing — from the court's order (with extensive citations) in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3960306576904580586">Meta Platforms, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
Courts disfavor the application of a survival clause which purport to extend in perpetuity. The U.S. Supreme Court has advised that courts should not construe ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises.
</p>

<p>
California courts have applied this presumption against perpetual agreements to various contexts, holding, for instance, in real estate contexts that a construction conferring a right in perpetuity will be avoided unless compelled by the unequivocal language of the contract.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, courts generally hold that, for a survival clause to be valid and enforceable, the clause must be limited in scope as to its geography and duration.
</p>

<p>
Courts have invalidated or limited the scope of perpetuity provisions in other contexts as well. <i>[Citations to cases involving perpetual nondisclosure covenants omitted.]</i>  
</p>

<p>
Survival clauses are generally limited to conduct that arises out of or shares a nexus to, the agreement.
</p>

<p>
* * *
</p>

<p>
The structure of the Terms thus supports Bright Data's construction of the survival clause as an enforcement mechanism, not an independent creator of lifetime bans.
</p>

<p>
It would be absurd that someone who opens a Facebook account for seconds, or even minutes, before deleting that account would be permanently giving up important legal rights the rest of society enjoys, and that they too enjoyed just minutes before, with no opportunity to ever get them back. While visitors to Facebook would not be contractually barred from automated scraping of public information, a user who briefly signs up with Facebook for entirely legitimate reasons would be barred for life from that same conduct. <i>[At text acc. n.7.]</i>

"<b>A 60-day termination for convenience translates to a 60-day contract</b>," one CFO at a supplier told us.

<p>
Suppose that a services provider ("Vendor"), upon agreeing to a statement of work, had invested money to find, recruit, and train extra people to do the work. 
</p>

<p>
Or perhaps the Vendor had invested in extra equipment that would be needed. 
</p>

<p>
In either of these cases, a sudden termination at will by the Customer could leave the Vendor stuck with:

<ul class="org-ul">

<p>
If your client will be making a significant investment of time or money in the Con&shy;tract, then you might want to try to negotiate restrictions on the other party's right to terminate at will, so as to allow your client at least some minimum time in which to try to recoup at least some part of that investment.
</p>

<p>
Such restrictions could include, for example:
</p>

<p>
1.  imposing a minimum advance notice requirement;

<p>
2.  allowing termination at will <b>only</b> (for example):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>a <b>minimum advance-notice period</b> — in the case of a services agreement, this would give the provider some time to try to find other work for the provider's people who were assigned to the customer's project (and thus help avoid layoffs); and/or</li>

In a dispute between Pepsi Cola and one of its independent bottlers, the Second Circuit noted:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Under New York law, it is well settled that <b>a contract of indefinite duration is terminable at will unless</b> the contract states expressly and unequivocally that the parties intend to be perpetually bound. &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
If it appears that no termination date was within the contemplation of the parties, or that their intention with respect thereto cannot be ascertained, the contract will be held to be <b>terminable within a reasonable time or revocable at will</b> . . . . Contracts of exclusive agency and distributorship are terminable at will in the absence of an express provision of duration. &#x2026; <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17835369695398865672">Compania Embotelladora Del Pacifico, S.A. v.

(Drafters should consider what would constitute "a reasonable time" and "reasonable notice" in assessing what might be desired by way of restrictions on termination at will.)
</p>

<p>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: Concerning a contract for sharing songwriting royalties for songs by the 1970s band Supertramp: The Ninth Circuit held that the band's two principal songwriters could <b>not</b> terminate the contract at will — and thus stop sharing their songwriting royalties with other band members and the band's manager — because under California law, the contract had an <b>implied</b> term, to wit: as long as the songs continued to generate royalties. The opinion extensively discusses factors that the court regarded as establishing an implied term. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3774300368034410873">Thomson v. Hodgson</a>, 150 F.4th 1097, 1103-06 (9th Cir. 2025) (reversing judgment on jury verdict for defendants and remanding with direction to enter judgment for plaintiffs on issue of liability). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The opinion also mentions how copyright royalties typically work in the music business — which led to the band members' entering into the contract in suit because the two songwriting members were making a lot more money than the other members and the manager. <cite> <i>See id.</i>, 150 F.4th at 1107. </cite>

<p>
(Judge Wardlaw's law clerk — or perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_McLane_Wardlaw">the judge herself</a> — might be a Supertramp fan: The introduction to the opinion is sprinkled with the band's song titles.)

<p>
The law might provide some contractual fences around an automatic termination-at-will right; as the Second Circuit noted in its <i>Pepsi</i> decision:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; In some circumstances, New York law imposes a <b>reasonable-duration requirement</b> on <b>exclusive</b> distribution agreements that are otherwise terminable at will. Such a requirement <b>may</b> arise in circumstances such as these where a distributor must <b>invest</b> in equipment, materials, and other assets to perform its obligations under the contract. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17835369695398865672">Compania Embotelladora</a>, 979 F.3d at 245, 246 (2d Cir. 2020) (cleaned up, citations omitted, emphasis added). </cite>

<p>
Relatedly: A termination at will might be held to violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing — <b>if</b> that implied covenant is recognized in the jurisdiction in question.  EXAMPLE: In <i>Davidson Oil</i> (10th Cir. 2024), the City of Albuquerque was a party to a requirements contract in which Davidson Oil would supply all of Albuquerque's needs for gasoline and diesel fuel at a fixed price. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When fuel market prices dropped, Albuquerque exercised a termination for convenience provision in its contract with Davidson Oil.</li>
<li>But Davidson Oil had entered into hedge contracts to cabin its own risk from market fluctuations — and the city knew this.</li>
<li>Davidson Oil sued the city for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court affirmed summary judgment awarding Davidson Oil the value of the hedge contracts. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9518672862511176142">Davidson Oil Co. v. City of Albuquerque</a>, 108 F.4th 1226 (10th Cir 2024). </cite>

<p>
A.&nbsp; This deadline forces the terminating party to make up its mind. It follows the maxim that contract rights and obligations should generally have a "sunset," so as not to be indefinitely hanging over other parties' heads.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 1's deadline is written as "three months" after learning of the event, instead of "90 days," to spare the reader from having to count days. On that subject, see the definition of <i>month</i> at Protocol <a href="#month-defn">22.27</a>.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; The countdown clock starts ticking on subdivision 1's termination deadline when the terminating party first learns of the triggering event affecting the other party. To be sure: The terminating party might prefer for its termination countdown clock to start running only upon formal notice of the triggering event from the other party. That, though, might be too burdensome for the other party to manage.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; In contrast: Subdivision 2's "outside" termination deadline has in mind that if the terminating party hasn't seen fit to terminate within the stated period — for example, because the terminating party simply hasn't noticed any material ill effects from a triggering event — then perhaps the terminating party right to terminate ought to quietly go away.

<p>
A.&nbsp; This Protocol fleshes out a general doctrine under American law, namely that <b>a <i>material</i> breach by one party excuses the other party from continuing to perform</b> its own obligations under the contract. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15968091742767073061">Walmart, Inc., v. Cuker Interactive, LLC</a>, 949 F.3d 1101, 1111-12 (8th Cir. 2020) (affirming judgment on jury verdict in favor of Cuker). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> It might be feasible to leave out a material-breach termination provision. That's because at common law, if a party breaches a contract in a way that deprives the other party of its reasonably-anticipated benefit from the contract, then the other party may <b>suspend</b> its own <b>future</b> performance. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2315833403516432347">Earth Power A/C and Heat, Inc. v. Page</a>, 604 S.W.3d 519, 524 (Tex. App.&#x2013;Houston [14th Dist.] 2020) (reversing and rendering to restore jury verdict, awarding attorney fees to contractor per contract).  ]
</p>

<p>
In contrast, if a breach is <span class="underline">not</span> material, then the other party must continue performing (but may sue for damages for the breach). <cite> <i>See id</i>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Still, many contracts spell out this right anyway so as not to leave it up to "interpretation" of the contract — which could result in costly, time-spending "creative" lawyering by one or both parties. Such contracts generally state that if a breaching party doesn't cure a material breach in a stated amount of time, then the other party may terminate the contract.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Absent a contract provision such as this Protocol, <b>under the general law the other party might <i>not</i> necessarily be able to <i>terminate</i> the contract</b> — as opposed to <i>suspending</i> its own performance — just because of the first party's material breach; that could depend on all the surrounding circumstances.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Caution</b>: This Protocol uses the phrase "<b>the <i>Terminating</i> Party</b>" and <span class="underline">not</span> "the non-breaching party." The latter term can cause serious problems if <i>both</i> parties are in breach, as discussed at <a href="#termin-nonbreach">20.9.2.2</a>.
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Note that under section <a href="#termin-trans">20.9.1.1</a> of Protocol <a href="#r-termin-ground">20.9</a>, the Terminating Party could terminate just a purchase order, statement of work, etc., instead of terminating the Con&shy;tract as a whole.

{ {{UN}}} Relatedly: If you want to terminate because the other party is in material breach, but you yourself are in breach, then you might not be able to use the "but they breached <i>first</i>!" argument — i.e., that the other party's "first material breach" justified your own material breach — if the you waived that possibility.

In today's global economy, "offshore" companies do a great deal of manufacturing for U.S. and European firms.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-r-termin-rep-risk-defn">
<p>
For purposes of this Protocol, the term "<b>Reputation Risk Action</b>" refers to any action (for this purpose including omissions) or series of actions, whether related or unrelated, where the action is (i) intended by the actor, or (ii) reasonably likely, to do one or more of the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>libel or slander another person;</li>

<li>put another person in a false light;</li>

<li>threaten, embarrass, harass, or invade the privacy of another;</li>

<li>impersonate another or promote, encourage, or assist in, such impersonation;</li>

<li><a id="org1178aae"></a> offend a reasonable person on racial- or ethnic grounds;</li>

<li>engage in conduct prohibited by law, including for example the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;</li>

<li>encourage activities prohibited by law, including (for example) bribery; identity theft; child pornography; and terrorism;</li>

<li>engage in tortious conduct; and/or</li>

<li>mistreat a person, or promote, assist in, or encourage such mistreatment.</li>

This is intended as a guardrail against future "creative" arguments to the contrary. EXAMPLE: One example of expiration-as-termination attracted considerable local publicity in a 2020 case in the San Francisco Bay Area in California, where:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The NBA's Golden State Warriors basketball team elected not to exercise an option to renew the team's lease of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, where the team had played for years.</li>

<li>An arbitrator held that the lease's <i>expiration due to nonrenewal</i> was tantamount to a <i>termination</i> by the Warriors.</li>

<li>That termination triggered an obligation for the team to continue making payments on debt incurred by the government agency that owned the Coliseum.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The arbitrator's award was upheld by a district court, whose decision was affirmed on appeal. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3174888921484057445">Oakland-Alameda Cty.

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a North Dakota case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A service provider and a marketing company entered into a marketing agreement. The agreement included a provision for the marketing company to be paid a buy-out fee if the agreement was "terminated."</li>

<li>The agreement was for  initial period of three years, with automatic one-year renewals unless either party opted out of renewal. - After several years of automatic renewal, the service provider opted out of renewal — and didn't pay the buy-out fee.</li>

<li>The marketing company sued for the buy-out fee, but a federal trial court dismissed the case with prejudice, on grounds that "termination" didn't include non-renewal.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On appeal; the Eighth Circuit held that the service provider's non-renewal <i>could</i> constitute a termination, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If "termination" <i>didn't</i> include non-renewal, then "many of the contract’s provisions would have no effect &#x2026;."</li>

<li>The marketing agreement's survival clause <i>(see generally Protocol <a href="#r-survival-cls">20.1</a>)</i> addressed only "termination" but the surviving provisions were of the kind that would normally survive however the agreement came to an end. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca8/25-1069/25-1069-2026-01-29.html">Reinhardt Enterpr., LLC v.

A right to terminate <i>the Con&shy;tract</i> could have unexpected (and undesired) results; for example:
</p>

<p>
In a California case, a former employee quit her job — which had the effect of revoking the arbitration agreement in her employment agreement. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6886459522771379043">Vazquez v.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In the 8th Circuit's 2021 <i>Miller</i> case, an employee terminated her <i>employment agreement</i> — which that agreement expressly allowed her to do. To the employer's surprise, though, the termination had the side effect of terminating the employee's obligation not to compete with her former employer, because the noncompetition covenant stated that it would survive termination of <i>employment</i>, not that it would survive termination of the employment agreement. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17584396332083730448">Miller v.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In the Ninth Circuit's <i>BladeRoom</i> case, the "sunset" termination of a confidentiality agreement (a.k.a. nondisclosure agreement a.k.a. "NDA") resulted in a disclosing party's loss of its right to enforce agreed confidentiality obligations against a recipient of confidential information — and the overturning of a $30 million jury verdict in the disclosing party's favor. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13542985516140860336">BladeRoom Grp.

Tangentially: The wording of a merger agreement's termination clause wiped out a party's breach-of-contract claims; as the court explained:

If a contract authorizes a party to terminate because of the other party's breach, the authorization should refer to that party as "the terminating party" or "the other party," <i>not</i> as "the non-breaching party." EXAMPLE: In the Silicon Valley <i>Powertech</i> case (N.D.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-assmt-bf-meme">
<p>
A party might look for a supposed material breach of contract as a reason — or a fabricated excuse — to terminate that contract and take up with another, more-lucrative party. That motivation might well have been at work in the 4th Circuit's <i>Hess Energy</i> case cited at <a href="#termin-own-goal">20.9.2.4</a> below, where "Lightning acknowledged that its purpose in signing [a contract with a new party] was to obtain a better price than it had obtained from Hess Energy." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15576247741045608683">Hess Energy</a>, 276 F.3d at 648 (4th Cir. 2002). </cite>

<div id="outline-container-termin-own-goal" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="termin-own-goal"><span class="section-number-5">20.9.2.4.</span> Caution: Don't do an own-goal termination for material breach</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-termin-own-goal">
<p>
As mentioned at <a href="#termin-nonbreach">20.9.2.2</a> above, improper termination of a contract for breach could itself be an "own goal" breach of contract. 
</p>

<p>
(A widely-used dictionary, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/own%20goal">Merriam-Webster.com</a>, defines "own goal" as: "1 <i>chiefly British</i> : a goal in soccer, hockey, etc., that a player accidentally scores against his or her own team [¶] 2 <i>chiefly British</i> something that one does thinking it will help him or her but that actually causes one harm[.]")
</p>

<p>
Imagine this: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You want to get out of a contract.</li>

<li>You conclude that the other side has materially breached the contract.</li>

<li>You send a notice of breach, but the other side fails to cure the breach (or perhaps you claim that the breach is incurable).</li>

<li>So, you send a notice of termination.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But then the other side files a counterclaim — and in litigation, counterclaims pretty much <i>always</i> happen.
</p>

<p>
In the end, a court holds that the other party's breach wasn't "material" after all —  as a result, you didn't have the right to terminate, and so <i>your termination</i> was a repudiation of the contract, <i>and thus a breach in itself</i>.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Southland Metals</i> (8th Cir. 2015), an iron foundry terminated a contract with a reseller — allegedly for material breach — but also because the foundry wanted to organize an internal sales force (in other words, to move its sales efforts in-house). The reseller sued for breach, both because it denied having itself breached and because the foundry supposedly didn't follow the contract's notice-and-cure termination procedure. A jury awarded the reseller for nearly $4 million in damages for improper termination; the Eighth Circuit affirmed judgment on the verdict. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17516483583354092033">Southland Metals, Inc. v. American Castings, LLC</a>, 800 F.3d 452 (8th Cir. 2015). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Other cases have been to similar effect.<sup><a id="fnr.TerminOwnGoal" class="footref" href="#fn.TerminOwnGoal" role="doc-backlink">33</a></sup>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-matl-br-dam-cmt">
<p>
A party might breach a contract but then be held not liable because the other party failed to prove its damages case, i.e., the dollar amount by which the other party was harmed by the breach.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: This happened in <i>SwiftAir</i> (Cal. App. 2022), where the court affirmed a take-nothing judgment in favor of Southwest Airlines, on grounds that jury found SwiftAir didn't meet its burden of proving that Southwest's breach of a particular contract (a beta-test agreement) had caused SwiftAir's alleged damages. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9462861142224609283">SwiftAir, LLC v.

Terms such as this Protocol can often be seen in some long-term services agreements, such as so-called "software as a service" agreements and outsourcing agreements, in which a provider is to take over important functions of the customer's internal operations. When a customer enters into such a long-term agreement, it might well want to prohibit <i>the supplier</i> from terminating the contract (generally while preserving the customer's right to do so).

A.&nbsp; <i>Every</i> human relationship comes to an end eventually — bar none. So, prudence suggests planning for an orderly "shut-down" of the relationship.

<p>
(By analogy: "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceful_exit">Graceful exit</a>" is part of the ethos of computer programming: When an app or other software shuts down — or encounter a fatal bug — it should do so in an orderly manner, without inadvertently crashing — or locking up — the phone, tablet, or computer.)

To that end, this Protocol provides contracting parties with a way for, say, a reseller of a manufacturer's "widgets" to wind up its then-pending sales deals with prospective end-customers if the reseller's contract with the manufacturer comes to an end.

That's generally <span class="underline">not</span> a good idea, even though that concept can be found in U.S. securities regulations such as , <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.405">SEC Rule 405</a> (whose text is similar to what's seen in other sources).
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> In the <i>UBS Securities</i> case discussed below, lack of a clear contractual definition of <i>control</i> led to a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6711830684594027629">$17 million legal-malpractice verdict</a> against a blue-chip NYC law firm for failing to nail down the definition to its client's hindsight liking.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <i>In a regulatory context</i>, just plain "management power," without the "legally-enforceable" part, might be acceptable, despite its vagueness. But in a <i>commercial</i> context, the vagueness of the generic term could lead to expensive, time-consuming litigation.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Offshore Drilling</i> (5th Cir. 2010), the parties were forced to litigate which party had "control" of a vessel that was destroyed by fire — and thus which party or parties should be liable for damages. The outcome isn't important for our purposes here, just that the dispute was certainly costly to the parties. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14794871969741142487">Offshore Drilling Co. v. Gulf Copper & Mfg. Corp.</a>, 604 F.3d 221 (5th Cir. 2010). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>UBS Securities</i> (N.Y. App. 2010), the uncertain meaning of "control," as used in a contract, meant that the parties had to litigate whether investment bank UBS was entitled to a $10 million fee from a company, Red Zone, headed by Daniel Snyder, the owner of what was then called the Washington Redskins NFL team. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11968574234665276251">UBS Securities LLC v.

</p>

<p>
A knock-on effect of the <i>UBS</i> lawsuit was that Red Zone scored a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6711830684594027629">$17 million legal-malpractice verdict</a> against its blue-chip NYC law firm for failing to nail down the definition of <i>control</i> to Red Zone's hindsight liking. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6711830684594027629">Red Zone LLC v.

Drafters might want to consider about what should happen in case of a change of affiliate status, e.g., because an existing affiliate gets sold to another company. <i>Example:</i> Suppose that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>A</i> and <i>B</i> enter into a contract under which <i>B</i> is obligated to do certain things for <i>A</i>'s affiliates (e.g., grant special pricing, or allow access to <i>B</i>'s trade secrets).</li>

<li>And now suppose that <i>A</i> acquires a new affiliate — namely one of <i>B</i>'s competitors, which acquired ownership of <i>A</i> in a merger transaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Clearly <i>B</i> might be unhappy about having to share its trade secrets with its competitor, so <i>B</i>'s drafter(s) should keep that possibility in mind.

<p>
EXAMPLE: <i>Ellington v. EMI Music</i> involved the estate of the legendary musician Duke Ellington. New York's highest court held that: "Absent explicit language demonstrating the parties' intent to bind future affiliates of the contracting parties, the term 'affiliate' includes only those affiliates in existence at the time that the contract was executed." <cite> <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/Decisions/2014/Oct14/156opn14-Decision.pdf">Ellington v.

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> In <i>GTE Wireless</i> (1st Cir. 2003), the First Circuit held that a company, Cellexis, had breached a settlement agreement not to sue GTE <i>(now part of Verizon)</i> or its affiliates when it sued a company that, at the time of the settlement agreement, had not been a GTE affiliate, but that later <i>became</i> an affiliate.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-22-1-7-1">
<p>
Sometimes contracting parties will care about what constitutes an "affiliate" of a party, because —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The contract might give certain <b>rights</b> to "affiliates" of one or another party. This could be, for example, the right to acquire goods or services on the same terms as in the contract. [DCT TO DO: Find examples in master service agreements / master purchase agreements]</li>

<li>The contract might also impose <b>obligations</b> on a party, where those obligations are tied in somehow with affiliates of one or another party (e.g., an obligation to be financially responsible for actions of an affilate).</li>
</ul>

<p>
In either situation, it might be important to know just who qualifies as an affiliate of the relevant party at the relevant time or times.
</p>


<figure id="org403b4fb">
<img src="./img/Affiliate-Alphabet-Google-YouTube-Fitbit.png" alt="Alphabet affiliates" title="Alphabet affiliates" class="photowidth40">

</figure>

<p>
Here are some real-world example of <i>affiliates</i> under the <i>control</i> and <i>common control</i> branches in the above text:
</p>

<p>
Both Google and YouTube are subsidiaries of "parent company" Alphabet Inc. — so:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Alphabet and <i>Google</i> are affiliates of each other under subdivision 1 because Alphabet controls Google; ditto for Alphabet and <i>YouTube</i>;</li>
<li><i>Google</i> and <i>YouTube</i> are affiliates of each other under subdivision 2 because they're both under the common control of Alphabet.</li>
<li>Fitbit is a subsidiary of Google, so Fitbit is an <i>indirect</i> subsidiary of Alphabet as well as a <i>direct</i> subsidiary of Google.</li>
<li>Fitbit is likewise an affiliate of YouTube because of their common control by Alphabet.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="nl-affil-defn-corr-pty"><span class="section-number-5">22.1.7.2.</span> <b>Caution:</b> Which is the correct <i>contracting party</i>?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-affil-defn-corr-pty">
<p>
In corporate "families," different affiliates can share variations on the same name. EXAMPLE: The global technology company Apple has subsidiaries including Apple Sales International Ltd. and Apple Operations International Ltd., both of which were directly involved in a <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=3D507358C4D7D56D6D9A933DEE558FC5?text=&docid=289923&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=2608624">decision</a> by the European Court of Justice that Apple owed Ireland some €13 billion (USD $14.4 billion). 
</p>

<p>
Not naming the correct company as a party to the contract could end up being financially disastrous for one or more other parties. EXAMPLE: In a Seventh Circuit case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The plaintiff, which we'll call "Target," was having business difficulties and badly wanted to be acquired by the defendant, "Buyer."</li>

<li>When Target entered into the acquisition agreement, the other named party was not Buyer, but Buyer Sub, a newly-created subsidiary of Buyer, which was to acquire Target's assets and pay Target the purchase price in the form of an <a href="#c-earn-out">earnout</a>.</li>

<li>Evidently, Target couldn't get Buyer to <a href="#r-guar-proto">guarantee</a> Buyer Sub's payment obligations (see Protocol <a href="#r-guar-proto">9.5</a>) — and sure enough, later a dispute arose over payments that Buyer Sub had withheld.</li>

<li>Target went to court for the withheld payments; it sued not just Buyer Sub — which had no assets and so was judgment-proof — but also <i>Buyer</i>, i.e., the parent company of Buyer Sub.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Buyer successfully sought summary judgment dismissing it from the case; in affirming, the Seventh Circuit court didn't even reach the merits: "It goes without saying that a contract cannot bind a nonparty. If [Target] is entitled to damages for breach of contract, it cannot recover them in a suit against [Buyer] because [Buyer] was not a party to the contract." Quoting one of its prior cases, the appellate court also implicitly noted that Buyer had not guaranteed Buyer Sub's payment obligations; the trial court had previously noted that "[Target] has offered no evidence that [Buyer] agreed to be liable for [Buyer Sub's] debts, obligations, and liabilities &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7341524000586289043">Northbound Group, Inc. v. Norvax, Inc.</a>, 795 F.3d 647, 650, 653 (7th Cir. 2015) (cleaned up, emphasis added), <i>affirming</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11445428986521429895">5 F.

EXAMPLE: In a Delaware chancery-court case, employees of an LLC were granted equity interests in the LLC's <i>parent company</i>. The employees' equity agreement included a covenant not to compete with the <i>parent company</i>, but said nothing about not competing with <i>the LLC itself</i>, i.e., the actual employer. The Delaware chancery court held that the covenant <i>didn't</i> prevent the employees from leaving and going to work for a competitor of <i>the employer</i>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12965075467964083915">Frontline Technologies v.

<h5 id="r-affil-defn-no-pty"><span class="section-number-5">22.1.7.3.</span> <b>Caution:</b> Don't list a party to the Con&shy;tract as "ABC Corp. <i>and affiliates</i>"</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-r-affil-defn-no-pty">
<p>
It's usually a bad idea for a contract's preamble to state that the contract is between (for example) "ABC Corporation ('Customer') <i>and its affiliates</i> and XYZ Inc. ('Supplier').
</p>

<p>
Why might that even come up? Well, suppose that ABC is negotiating a master purchase agreement with XYZ. Not unusually, ABC wants its various affiliates to be able to place orders with XYZ on the same master agreement, so that the affiliates won't have to incur the cost and delay of renegotiating terms and conditions with XYZ.
</p>

<p>
It'd be easy — and ABC might ask — to recite, in the master purchase agreement, that the parties are as quoted above. <i>But that's not a great idea</i>, unless each ABC affiliate actually signs the agreement as a party, committing, on its own, to upholding the obligations in the master purchase agreement. Experienced commentators seem to agree. <cite> See, e.g., Mark Anderson, <a href="https://ipdraughts.wordpress.com/2014/01/12/dont-make-affiliates-parties-to-the-agreement/">Don't Make Affiliates parties to the agreement</a> (2014); Ken Adams, <a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/parent-on-behalf-of-affiliate/">Having a Parent Company Enter Into a Contract "On Behalf" of an Affiliate</a> (2008). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Thus, a safer practice would be to state the specific rights and obligations that affiliates have under the contract, instead of making them parties. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Massachusetts case, a contract listed one of the parties as Uber Brasil "and its Affiliates"; a trial court held that this was a factor in determining that the parent company, Uber Technologies [U.S.], was an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract's forum-selection agreement. <cite> See <a href="./Zemcar_Decision.pdf">Zemcar Inc. v. Uber Techs., Inc.</a>, No. 2484CV01525-BLS2, slip op. at 15 (Mass. Super.

<p>
EXAMPLE: In an English High Court (trial court) case, the contract between a tech company and an investment-banking firm included what the court referred to as "an oddity" in its drafting: "[T]he opening words of the Agreement contemplate <i>[the investment bank]</i> acting for <i>[the tech company]</i> <b>and 'its affiliates'</b>, &#x2026; who are all collectively defined as the 'Company.'" That was one of a many complications in the court's task of determining whether the (ambiguous) contract required the tech company to pay the investment bank a success fee when the tech company raised capital from its parent company, not from any third party referred by the investment bank. (The court ultimately concluded that the answer was "no.") <cite> <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2024/3164">Kigen (UK) Ltd. v NOR Capital Ltd.</a>, [2024] EWHC 3164 (Ch), ¶¶ 28, 90-91. </cite>

<p>
When a contract addresses affiliates' rights, it might include language such as the following, adapted from the real-life <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1546640/000119312512297959/d269082dex1011.htm">Master Supply & Purchasing Agreement</a> of one subsidiary of the alarm company ADT Corporation: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Each Affiliate shall only be liable for those obligations expressly set forth in the Purchase Order to which it is a party. <i>In no event will Buyer be liable for any of the obligations or liabilities of any Affiliate</i> pursuant to this Agreement.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In such a situation, the supplier might want to consider doing one or both of the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Put in the draft contract a provision that the supplier may reject an affiliate's order — ideally for any reason or no reason, but at a minimum if the supplier has reasonable concerns about the affiliate's ability to pay; and/or</li>

<li>Get the (solvent) parent company, or some other specific, <i>creditworthy</i> affiliate of the named customer, to guarantee payment of all orders when a customer affiliate is the buyer (see § <a href="#purch-ord-affil">15.9.10</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
This could turn out to be important. EXAMPLE: In a California case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A dispute arose between Huy Fong, a famed manufacturer of sriracha hot sauce, and Underwood Ranches, a pepper grower, because Huy Fong wanted Underwood to deal with a newly-created Huy Fong subsidiary, Chilico.</li>

<li>Chilico, though, "did not have the assets to ensure that Underwood would be paid <i>and Huy Fong refused to guarantee the Chilico contract</i>."</li>

<li>The dispute turned bitter, with the parties suing each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the end, it worked out sort-of OK for Underwood: After years of costly litigation, a California jury awarded Underwood $13 million in compensatory damages and $10 million for fraud. 
</p>

<p>
But the case illustrates why parties and their contract drafters should consider the risk of doing business with the "wrong" company in a corporate "family." <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6588631383722707662">Huy Fong Foods, Inc. v.

A.&nbsp; A problem with using the term "or" alone is that, in some circumstances, a court might read "or" as being tantamount to "and." EXAMPLE: As the court noted in <i>Capital Finance</i> (D. Md. 2019):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Maryland law recognizes that the word "and" may unambiguously require a <i>disjunctive</i> reading in light of the character of the contract in which it appears. &#x2026; Conversely, the word "or" may require a <i>conjunctive</i> reading. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9118885414511489456">Capital Finance, LLC v. Rosenberg</a>, 364 F. Supp. 3d 529, 545-46 (D. Md. 2019) (citing cases; emphasis added), <i>aff'd in relevant part</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9995121034561022670">No. 19-1202</a>, slip op. (4th Cir. 2020) (unpublished). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Delaware chancery court held that <i>in context</i>, the term "and" in a contract provision must be read as "or"; affirming, the state supreme court provided an extensive review of precedent concerning <i>and</i> and <i>or</i>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15745760653352237882">Weinberg v. Waystar</a>, No. 2021-1023-SG (Del. Ch. Jul. 6, 2022) (granting summary judgment), <i>aff'd</i> , <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3136398182146528491">94 A.3d 1039</a> (Del. 2023). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Pulsifer</i> (U.S. 2024), the U.S. Supreme Court had to decide whether a particular federal criminal statute used the word "and" in the conjunctive or disjunctive sense. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1665988217310336793">Pulsifer v. United States</a> , 601 U.S. 124 (2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
So: It can be useful to say <i>and/or</i> to be clear what's meant. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <a id="orgf48eb88"></a> Amusingly, the term <i>and/or</i> has provoked scorn from some purists, as well-documented by Professor Robbins. <cite> See Ira P. Robbins, <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3783&context=mlr">“And/Or” and the Proper Use of Legal Language</a>, 77 Md. L. Rev. 311 (2018). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Granted, it's possible to use <i>and/or</i> inappropriately, as with any term. <cite> See,, e.g., Wayne Schiess, <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/legalwriting/2013/01/22/in-the-land-of-the-andorians/">In the land of the Andorians</a> (UTexas.edu 2013). </cite>
</p>

<p>
But as Professor Robbins correctly notes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
And/or, however, is not ambiguous at all. It has a definite, agreed-upon meaning: when used properly, the construct signifies “A or B or both.” <b>In most areas of law, there is simply no compelling reason to avoid using and/or</b>. The term is clear and concise. It derives criticism mainly from instances in which people use it incorrectly. <cite> Robbins, <a href="#orgf48eb88">cited above</a>, at 311, emphasis and extra paragraphing added. </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
D.&nbsp; Moreover, trying to ban <i>and/or</i> entirely is almost surely a bootless errand:  In real life, drafters will continue to use <i>and/or</i> because of its utility or through force of habit.  
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; So the better practice might well be: <b>Just define the term</b> — as here — <b>and stop worrying about it</b>.  <i>(W.I.D.D. — When In Doubt, Define!)</i>
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; Ken Adams, author of <a href="http://apps.americanbar.org/abastore/index.cfm?pid=5070661&section=main&fm=Product.AddToCart">A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting</a>, usefully <a href="https://www.adamsdrafting.com/a-b-and-or-c/">suggests</a> that, when dealing with a list of three or more items, it's better to write, "<i>one or more of</i> A, B, and C."
</p>

<p>
G.&nbsp; Another alternative: In the final paragraph of <i>Carley Foundry</i> (Minn. App. 2010, unpublished), a state-court judge — no slave to brevity, it seems — excoriated the use of <i>and/or</i> as "an indolent <i>[!]</i> way to express a series of items that might exist in the conjunctive, but might also exist in the disjunctive"; the judge proclaimed that a drafter could instead "express a series of items as, A, B, C, and D together, or any combination together, or any one of them alone."

Here it is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
"Change of Control" of Licensee means a transaction or series of related transactions resulting in:

<p>
(a) the acquisition of ownership, directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record, by any individual, entity or group, of equity interests representing more than 50% of the aggregate ordinary voting power or beneficial interest represented by the issued and outstanding equity interests in Licensee;

(b) the consummation by Licensee <i>or any direct or indirect parent</i> of Licensee of a merger or consolidation with any other entity or any other such group; or

<p>
Licensee shall notify Licensor in writing of a Change of Control within thirty days of its occurrence.

This Agreement will terminate at any time immediately upon written notice by Licensee following a Change of Control.  <i>[Huh? What does this mean?]</i>

(By comparison: In the United States, <i>criminal</i> charges generally must be proved by evidence "beyond a reasonable doubt" — that is, before the government may imprison someone, the government's prosecutors must put on evidence that, in the view of <i>both</i> a neutral judge and a neutral jury, rises to that level of proof.)

C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> A California trial court held that Tesla Motors's employee-arbitration agreement was unenforceable because a separate employee nondisclosure and invention-assignment agreement was "permeated" by unconscionability. The trial court's ruling was based in part on the latter agreement's requiring the employee to prove that information was in the public domain <i>[sic]</i> (see § <a href="#conf-info-excl-pub">11.3.9</a>), and thus excluded from confidentiality obligations, by clear and convincing evidence. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4550789252196877487">Wise v. Tesla Motors, Inc.,</a> No. A170983, part I.A, slip op. (Cal. App. Dec. 22, 2025). The appellate court reversed the trial court's refusal to sever the unconscionable provisions from the arbitration agreement without addressing the unconscionability finding itself. </cite>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-effective-date">

In many cases, a contract will state that certain rights and obligations are tied to the "effective date" of the contract. <b>Example:</b> A confidentiality agreement might state that the agreement protects only confidential information that's disclosed to the recipient during a stated number of months after the agreement's effective date.
</p>

<p>
In addition, it's not uncommon for contracting parties to want to "backdate" their agreement — a typical example is backdating a confidentiality agreement, as discussed at <a href="#confid-oblig-effect">22.18.2.2</a>.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-confid-oblig-effect">
<p>
Signing a contract that is "backdated" to be effective as of an earlier date might well be OK. (This is referred to in Latin legalese as <i>nunc pro tunc</i>, or "now for then.") The contract itself should make it clear that parties are doing this, to help forestall later accusations that one or both parties had an intent to deceive.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Suppose that "Alice" discloses confidential information to "Bob," a potential business partner, after Bob first <b>orally</b> agrees to keep the information confidential. Alice might well want to enter into a <b>written</b> nondisclosure agreement with Bob that states the agreement and its confidentiality obligations are effective as of the date of Alice’s oral disclosure. 
</p>

<p>
To that end, Alice and Bob could include language in the Con&shy;tract along the following lines:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org16a9835">
<p>
This Agreement is being signed on the date(s) indicated in the signature blocks, but it will be effective as of <i>[date]</i>; the parties intend that this Agreement will confirm, and replace, an <i>oral</i> confidentiality agreement entered into by the parties during discussions on or about that date.
</p>

<b>Caution:</b> Falsely stating the <i>signature dates</i> (as opposed to the effective date of the contract) could be problematic, and even lead to prison time, as discussed at <a href="#sig-date-alice">2.10.5</a>.

In one case, Rhode Island's supreme court rejected a borrower's argument that a lender had miscalculated a particular amount owed, because the calculation exactly matched one of the illustrative examples in a disclosure statement — signed by the borrower — in the relevant loan document. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/rhode-island/supreme-court/2025/24-208.html">Guilmette v. PHH Mortgage Services Corp.</a>, No. 2024-208, slip op. at 10 (R.I. Jul. 2, 2025) (affirming summary judgment). </cite>
</p>

<p>
In another case, the drafters of $49 million of promissory notes would have been well served to include a sample calculation to illustrate one of their financial-term definitions. The court specifically mentioned particular calculations that the lender had submitted with its motion for summary judgment; if the promissory-note drafters had thought to include one or two sample calculations in the body of the contract itself, then by being forced to work through those sample calculations, the drafters and their client(s) might well have spotted the problems with the promissory-note language in time to fix it before signature. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17992930225815203922">BKCAP, LLC v.

Examples are one of the most effective <i>teaching</i> tools. That's significant here because one of the principal goals of any contract is to educate the parties' business people — and, possibly, future judges and jurors — about just what the parties have agreed. 
</p>

<p>
An MIT note points out: "[I]n the field of law, worked examples have been used to teach students how to reason through legal cases and construct legal arguments, while worked examples have similarly been used to assist learners in understanding negotiation strategies." <cite> <a href="https://tll.mit.edu/teaching-resources/how-people-learn/worked-examples/">Worked Examples</a> (MIT.edu, undated; citations omitted), archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/2TYJ-ECFY">https://perma.cc/2TYJ-ECFY</a>. </cite>

<p>
One professor of education asserts that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026; When a student forms a concept from its examples, he or she knows more than the definition of a term (e.g., river: he or she also knows some vivid examples of the concept that add flesh to a bare-bones definition, such as the Mississippi, the Amazon, the Yangtze, and the Volga). This is deep conceptual learning rather than superficial knowledge of a vocabulary word. <cite> Walter Parker, <a href="https://teachinghistory.org/teaching-materials/teaching-guides/25184">Concept Formation</a> (TeachingHistory.org). </cite>

Examples can <b>speed up legal review</b> of a complex formula or some other particularly tricky provision — and help make sure the drafter(s) accurately captured the parties' agreement. So in any such case, drafters should consider including a hypothetical example or sample calculation that "talks through" how the formula or provision is intended to work — such as in the definition of <i>day</i> at <a href="#day-defn">22.15</a>.
</p>

<p>
(Alternatively, an example could be put in a footnote, as discussed at <a href="#fns">30.20</a>.)
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Seventh Circuit case, the drafters of $49 million of promissory notes would have been well served to include a sample calculation to illustrate one of their financial-term definitions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The court observed that the plain language of the promissory notes "would produce absurd results" and that while the language was clear, "it is nonetheless ambiguous because it makes no economic sense."</li>

<li>The court specifically mentioned that the "absurd results" were proved by the example calculations that the lender had submitted to the court with the lender's motion for summary judgment, <i>but that were not part of the promissory notes</i>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17992930225815203922">BKCAP, LLC v. CAPTEC Franchise Trust 2000-1</a>, 572 F.3d 353, 355-57, 359 (7th Cir.2009) ("BKCAP-1") (reversing and remanding summary judgment) <i>after remand</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9337429900318929332">688 F.3d 810</a> (7th Cir. 2012) (affirming judgment in favor of borrowers after bench trial). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
Now imagine that — during the deal negotiations — the drafters of the promissory notes had thought to include one or two such example calculations in the body of the notes. The drafters and their client(s), by being forced to work through those example calculations, might well have spotted the problems with the language in time to fix the problems before signature.

The term "<b>Hold harmless</b>" (whether or not capitalized) has the same meaning as <i>indemnify</i> (defined at Protocol <a href="#r-indem-defn">16.3</a>).

<div id="outline-container-org2d57e3a" class="outline-6 addl">
<h6 id="org2d57e3a">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org2d57e3a">
<p>
This definition reflects what seems to be a consensus by legal-writing experts and most courts: The term <i>hold harmless</i> is the second part of the doublet <i>indemnify and hold harmless</i> — it doesn't impose any separate obligation apart from <i>indemnify</i>. 
</p>

<p>
As explained by preeminent legal lexicographer Bryan Garner: "The evidence is overwhelming that <i>indemnify</i> and <i>hold harmless</i> are perfectly synonymous. The first is Latinate, the second Anglo-Saxon. And it would be possible to multiply 20th- and 21st-century authorities to this effect." <cite> See Bryan A. Garner, <a href="http://www.greenbag.org/v15n1/v15n1_articles_garner.pdf">indemnify</a> <i>[sic]</i>, 15 Green Bag 2d 17, 21 (2011), archived at <a href="http://perma.cc/4VBV-FDJS">http://perma.cc/4VBV-FDJS</a>; see also Bryan A.

</p>

<p>
True: This would seem to go against the usual rule that courts try to construe contracts so as to give effect to <i>each</i> provision, without ignoring any as "surplusage." But Garner addresses this problem in his <i>Green Bag</i> piece, at 22.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-matl-defns">
<p>
A.&nbsp; It's not uncommon for a contract — with an eye to future litigation — to include a stipulation about what can constitute a material breach (not unlike a liquidated-damages clause). Generally, the drafter is planning for the case where <i>the other party</i> breaches the contract, <b>to make it easier for the drafter's <i>client</i> to terminate the contract</b> and make the termination stick in court, without having to extensively litigate whether the breach is "material" or not.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A real-estate lease might state that the tenant's failure to pay rent when due, after notice and an opportunity to cure, is a <i>material</i> breach that would allow the landlord to terminate the lease.  Courts will often give effect to such contractual stipulations about materiality.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In its <i>Indiana v. IBM</i> decision, Indiana's supreme court held that under state's law, the contract's specification of agreed standards of materiality took precedence over a Restatement of Contracts analysis: "&#x2026; when a contract sets forth a standard for assessing the materiality of a breach, that standard governs. Only in the absence of such a contract provision does the common law, including the Restatement, apply." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18212127357674475170">Indiana v. IBM Corp.</a>, 51 N.E.3d 150, 153 (Ind. 2016). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: The "as a whole" language is modeled on section 16.3.1(1)(A) of the master service agreement in the <i>Indiana v. IBM</i> case, cited above.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Subdivision 2 might well reduce the likelihood of getting summary judgment about the materiality or immateriality of a partiuclar breach, because the "as a whole" requirement could be intensely factual. 
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; In non-breach contexts, something is often considered <i>material</i> (for example, material information) if a substantial likelihood exists that a reasonable person would consider the thing important in making a relevant decision. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5589356734421689123">Basic Inc. v. Levinson</a>, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988) (defining <i>material</i> in the context of securities law). </cite>
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Contract-drafting maven Ken Adams suggests <i>not</i> using the term "material," and instead using either "more than trivially" or "dealbreaker": "Using <i>dealbreaker</i> is novel, and it might seem awkward or insufficiently sober, but given the pervasive legalistic blather long inflicted on readers of traditional contract drafting, you should at least consider deploying a no-nonsense neologism." <cite> Kenneth A. Adams, <a href="https://www.adamsdrafting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Material-Is-Ambiguous-Scribes-1-Nov-2023.pdf">The Word Material Is Ambiguous in Contracts, Why That’s a Problem, and How to Fix It</a>, SCRIBES J.

The term "arising out of or relating to" is usually interpreted broadly by courts — as the Tenth Circuit explained concerning similar wording:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Courts have generally interpreted language such as "arising from or in connection with" quite expansively. 
</p>

<p>
To say that a dispute is one "arising from or in connection with maintenance performed by Williams" is to say that it had some causal connection to—that it originated from, grew out of, or flowed from—such maintenance. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14318267422855056360">Dodson Int'l Parts, Inc. v.

The term "relating to" is relatively broad (compared with the narrower "arising out of") but it's not of unlimited scope: In the context of determining the scope of an arbitration agreement, in 2017 the Ninth Circuit noted:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
And though we have recognized that the phrase 'relate to' is broader than the phrases 'arising out of' or 'arising under,' &#x2026; "related to" marks a barrier by indicating some direct relationship; otherwise the term would stretch to the horizon and have no limiting purpose &#x2026;. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4859409419094796454">United States and Nevada ex rel.

<p>
In 2023, Delaware's chancery court had this to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This Court has considered the connector "relating to" to be paradigmatically broad. Indeed, the term "relating to" is one of the far-reaching terms often used by lawyers when they wish to capture the broadest possible universe. Given its breadth, a provision that extends to matters "relating to" an agreement encompasses *any issues that touch on contract rights or contract performance." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14515735303092586419">Intrepid Investments, LLC v.

<p>
Following this principle, the Delaware court held that the plaintiff's new claims for <i>fraudulent transfer</i> were barred by the <i>res judicata</i> effect of a judgment in a prior lawsuit between the parties in <i>New York's</i> courts, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The plaintiff's new fraudulent-transfer claims did not "touch on" the rights and performance of an LLC operating agreement, which included a forum-selection clause requiring litigation in <i>Delaware</i> of any claim "arising out of or relating in any way to this [Operating] Agreement."</li>

<li>The plaintiff therefore <i>could</i> have brought the fraudulent-transfer in the <i>New York</i> lawsuit, not merely in Delaware.</li>

<li>Consequently, the new fraudulent-transfer claims were barred by the <i>res judicata</i> effect of the results in the New York lawsuit.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the other hand, said the Delaware court, the plaintiff's new claims for <i>tortious interference</i> were <i>not</i> barred by <i>res judicata</i> from the New York lawsuit because the tortious-interference claims <i>did</i> "touch on" the rights and performance of the LLC operating agreement, and so the claims <i>were</i> subject to the operating agreement's forum-selection clause, and thus could not have been brought in the New York lawsuit. 
</p>

<p>
Variation: In 2023, the First Circuit noted (in a dictum) that a third-party claim <i>might</i> "arise from" an indemnifying party's act but not be "caused" by the act. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7530458085226571031">Caruso v.

Business context: A contract will sometimes state that a party "represents" a fact, or perhaps that the party "represents and warrants" the fact.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-rep-ovvw">
<p>
A <i>representation</i> is generally understood as a statement of <i>past-</i> or <i>present</i> fact (and, rarely, of <i>future</i> fact). 
</p>

<p>
(Contrast with a <i>warranty</i>, which could also include future fact; see 
</p>

<p>
Whether a party that makes a representation will be liable for <em>mis</em>representation will depend on whether the party can prove a number of facts, discussed at <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a> above. 
</p>

<p>
(<a id="org480549b"></a> The "past or present fact" formulation is suggested by Professor Tina Stark <i>[RIP 12/21/2025]</i> in her highly-regarded <a href="https://aspenpublishing.com/products/stark-draftingcontracts2">Drafting Contracts</a> textbook.)

<p>
If you haven't already, take a look at the "Hill of Proof" diagram for representations and warranties, at  <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>, reproduced here for convenience:
</p>

<p>
As seen in the upper portion of the Hill of Proof: If Ginger represents a fact to Fred, and Fred later wants to sue Ginger for <i>misrepresentation</i>:
</p>

<p>
1.  Fred must show that he <b>relied</b> on Ginger's representation — but that usually won’t be a heavy burden if the representation is explicitly stated in the contract; in fact, Minnesota's supreme court held in 2014 that "a claim for breach of a <i>contractual</i> representation of future legal compliance is actionable under Minnesota law without proof of reliance." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5635424977645529329">Lyon Fin. Serv., Inc. v. Illinois Paper & Copier Co.</a>, 848 N.W.2d 539, 540 (Minn. 2014) (on certification from 7th Circuit) (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
And in a 2020 case, the Seventh Circuit, applying Illinois law, held that: "The <i>warranty</i> sued on here was part of the parties' agreement, so the plaintiff did not need to prove further reliance." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13686617775396044277">Abellan v. Lavelo Prop. Mgmt. LLC</a>, 948 F.3d 820, 832-33 (7th Cir. 2020) (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
2.  Fred must also show that his reliance on Ginger's representation was <b>reasonable</b> under the circumstances — again, the chances are that reasonableness of reliance would be <i>presumed</i>, but perhaps Ginger could show that reliance was <em>un</em>reasonable because Fred should have seen that the representation was problematic. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9763205046959591368">JPMorgan Chase Bank v. Orca Assets GP</a>, 546 S.W.3d 648 (Tex. 2018) (on the specific facts of the case, "red flags" made it unreasonable for plaintiff to rely on bank's alleged misrepresentations). </cite>
</p>

<p>
3.  And Fred must show that Ginger acted <i>negligently</i>, or recklessly, or even intentionally (i.e., fraudulently), in making the (mis)representation — i.e,. he must show that Ginger acted with <b>scienter</b>, discussed in more detail below.
</p>

<p>
If Fred can prove up these additional elements — over and above the elements required to prove breach of <em>warranty</em> — then he might well be entitled to tort-like remedies that would not normally be available for a plain breach of contract or warranty, such as punitive damages and/or rescission of the contract. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18400480939984717580">Nami Resources Co., L.L.C. v. Asher Land & Mineral, Ltd.</a>, 554 SW 3d 323, 328 (Ky. 2018) (vacating award of punitive damages for what was essentially a breach of contract); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14094199832776476684">Lucarell v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.</a>, 2018 Ohio 15, 152 Ohio St. 3d 453, 97 N.E.3d 458: "Ohio common law provides that punitive damages may not be awarded for breach of contract, no matter how willful the breach." (Citations omitted.) ]
</p>

<p>
In some jurisdictions, punitive damages might be available if the defendant's conduct would have been tortious outside the context of a contract. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15168663863371448426">Van Rees v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-rep-warr-scienter-fraud">
<p>
If Fred wants to prove that Ginger committed <i>fraud</i>, New York law is fairly typical: “The elements of a cause of action for fraud require a material misrepresentation of a fact, knowledge of its falsity, an intent to induce reliance, justifiable reliance by the plaintiff and damages." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17529806645169815170#p559">Eurycleia Partners, LP v.

</p>

<p>
Similarly, under Texas law, the Texas supreme court explained in its 2011 decision in <i>Italian Cowboy Partners</i>: 
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
The elements of fraud are: 
</p>

<p>
(1) that a material representation was made; 
</p>

<p>
(2) the representation was false; 
</p>

<p>
(3) when the representation was made, the speaker[:]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>knew</b> it was false or</li>

<li>made it <b>recklessly</b> without any knowledge of the truth and as a <b>positive assertion</b>;</li>
</ul>

<p>
(4) the speaker made the representation with the <b>intent</b> that the other party should act upon it; 
</p>

<p>
(5) the party <b>acted in reliance</b> on the representation; and (6) the party thereby suffered injury. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11381898603191801741#p337">Italian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v.

</p>




<p>
Note the <b>absence</b> here of a requirement that the plaintiff prove that the reliance was <i>justified</i> or <i>reasonable</i>; this is one respect in which Texas law differs from New York law (discussed just above).

Somewhat similarly, in <b>Texas</b> as in many other states, the courts follow <b>Restatement</b> (Second) of Torts § 552 (1977) in defining <i>negligent misrepresentation</i> as: 
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
(1) the representation is made by a defendant in the course of his business, or in a transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest; 
</p>

<p>
(2) the defendant supplies ‘false information’ for the guidance of others in their business; 
</p>

<p>
(3) the defendant did not exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information; and (4) the plaintiff suffers pecuniary loss by justifiably relying on the representation. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17172414221833309328#p442">Federal Land Bank Ass'n of Tyler v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-rel-waiver-cmtry">
<p>
One way to preempt a possibe fraud-in-the-inducement claim is for the contract to disclaim external <i>representations</i>. <b>But:</b> This requires a bit more work than simply disclaiming <i>warranties</i> that aren't stated expressly in the contract.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That's generally because, understandably, a court is likely to be reluctant to let a party off the hook if it appears that the party was untruthful, or even merely negligent, in what it said to another party.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-rep-future">
<p>
Contract drafters shouldn't use the term <i>represents</i> to indicate that a party will take or abstain from action — commitments to future action should instead be written as promises (covenants).

<p>
Why? Consider the first example above: If Ginger failed to pay Fred, she might try to claim that she should not be liable for nonpayment because <i>when she made the representation</i>, she had no reason to believe that she would not make the payment. A court might treat such a "representation" as a simple promise, but the drafter would do all concerned a disservice by not making the obligation explicit and unconditional. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5635424977645529329">Lyon Fin. Serv., Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-RelDisclBkgd">
<p>
In a contract dispute, an aggrieved party might well claim that another party "fraudulently induced" the aggrieved party into entering into the contract by making supposedly-false statements that weren't set out in the contract itself. This often happens in complex business- and technology cases, where a non-expert fact finder, such as a judge or juror, might not fully understand the details of a case — but she probably <i>would</i> understand the simple claim "they lied!" 
</p>

<p>
Bryan Garner points this out in his famed dictionary of legal usage:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
[S]ome parties to a contract don’t want merely a guarantee that so-and-so <i>will be so</i> in the future; they also want an eye-to-eye statement (representation) that the thing is so <i>now</i>. If it later turns out not to have been so when the representation was made, <b>the party claiming breach can complain of a lie.</b> &#x2026; If only a warranty were in place, the breaching party could simply say, “I’ll make good on your losses—as I always said I would—but I never told you that such-and such was the case.” Hence <i>representations and warranties</i>. <cite> Bryan A. Garner, <i>Representations and warranties</i>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195384202/">Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage</a> (3d ed. 2011) (quotation lightly edited), <i>quoted in</i> Ken Adams, <a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/revisiting-represents-and-warrants-bryan-garners-view/">Revisiting “Represents and Warrants”: Bryan Garner’s View</a> (AdamsDrafting.com 2011). </cite>

<p>
Fraud claims can also turn a relatively-straightforward business dispute into an expensive lawyer tangle, with lots of discovery requests and motion practice that increase costs for all concerned. 
</p>

<p>
The following sections offer a few real-world examples:
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <i>British Sky Broadcasting v. EDS</i>: British Sky Broadcasting ("Sky") contracted with EDS to develop a customer relationship management (CRM) software system. The project didn't go as planned, and Sky eventually filed suit. In the (non-jury) trial:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The judge concluded that EDS had made fraudulent misrepresentations when <i>one</i> of EDS's senior UK executives, wanting very much to get Sky's business, lied to Sky about EDS's analysis of the amount of elapsed time needed to complete the initial delivery and go-live of the system.</li>

<li>A limitation-of-liability clause in the EDS-Sky contract capped the potential <i>contract</i> damage award at £30 million.</li>

<li>By its terms, though, <i>that limitation of liability did not apply to fraudulent misrepresentations</i>. <cite> See <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/TCC/2010/86.html">BSkyB Ltd. v. HP Enterprise Services UK Ltd.</a>, [2010] EWHC 86 (TCC), paras. 194-196, 372-389. </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
In early June 2010, EDS reportedly agreed to pay Sky some US$460 million — <i>more than four times the value of the original contract</i> — to settle the case. <cite> See Jaikumar Vijayan, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9177843/EDS_settles_lawsuit_over_botched_CRM_project_for_460M">EDS settles lawsuit over botched CRM project for $460M</a>, Computerworld, June 9, 2010 ]
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In 2020, the Southern District of New York confirmed a €643 million arbitration award for fraudulent inducement to enter into a contract for the sale of a business. The arbitral tribunal had remarked that, "This is a case of true and pervasive fraud, where the active participants did not inadvertently stumble into mistakes, but rather took systematic steps to mislead Claimants and then to try to cover their trail." The limitation of liability in the contract (a damages cap) applied only to the seller's indemnity obligation, not to fraud claims. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8300108569999965851">Precision Castparts Corp. v. Schulz Holding GmbH & Co. KG</a>, No. 1:20-cv-03029 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 2020); see generally <a href="#r-lim-liab-usage">23.17</a> </cite>
</p>


<p target="_blank">
EXAMPLE: <i>Oregon v. Oracle</i>:  We see another example of "they lied!" in the 2014 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141014060142/https://www.oregon.gov/docs/082214_filing.pdf" target="_blank">$3 billion civil suit</a> filed by the state of Oregon against software giant Oracle Corporation, in which <i>the second paragraph of the complaint</i> said, in its entirety:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Oracle lied to the State about the “Oracle Solution.”
</p>

<p>
Oracle lied when it said the “Oracle Solution” could meet both of the State’s needs with Oracle products that worked “out-of-the-box.”
</p>

<p>
Oracle lied when it said its products were “flexible,” “integrated,” worked “easily” with other programs, required little customization and could be set up quickly. Oracle lied when it claimed it had “the most comprehensive and secure solution with regards to the total functionality necessary for Oregon.” <cite> Extra paragraphing added. For a related federal case, see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5907495941659858255">Oracle America, Inc. v. Oregon Health Ins. Exch. Corp.</a>, 80 F. Supp. 3d 1168 (2015) (disposing of various motions; recapping factual history at 1169). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>




<p>
Moreover, the state named various Oracle managers and executives, <i>personally</i>, as co-defendants in a multi-million lawsuit over a failed software development project, with the state suing one Oracle technical manager for $45 million (!).
</p>

<p>
The lawsuit was later <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2016/09/post_183.html">settled</a> — Oracle agreed to pay Oregon $25 million in cash and provide the state with another $75 million in technology. 
</p>

<p>
Here's a wild speculation, based on zero evidence: It seems possible that the state sued the individuals personally to try to motivate them to cooperate with the state, akin to when criminal prosecutors bring indictments against all kinds of people to encourage them to cooperate in return for dismissal or a lighter sentence.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A software developer found itself having to defend against a customer's claim that the developer had not only breached its contract but also that the developer induced the customer to enter into the contract "with false promises of its capabilities to perform web-related services." The Colorado supreme court held that those allegations "state a violation of a tort duty that is independent of the contract" and thus should not have been dismissed under the economic-loss doctrine. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15168663863371448426">Van Rees v. Unleaded Software, Inc.</a>, 2016 CO 51 ¶ 3, 373 P.3d 603, 605 (Colo. 2016). </cite>

<h5 id="rep-defn-rsnbl-basis-cmtry"><span class="section-number-5">22.34.6.8.</span> Pro tip: Disclaim <i>investigation</i> of representations?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-rep-defn-rsnbl-basis-cmtry">
<p>
Protocol <a href="#r-rep-defn">22.34</a> explicitly states that a party making a representation is also certifying that the party has a reasonable basis for the representation. This is to try to forestall parties from recklessly making representations about things of which they know not.  
</p>

<p>
(Compare with  <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_11">Rule 11</a>(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which states that a person signing a federal-court pleading is certifying the contents "to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances &#x2026;.")
</p>

<p>
This could end up being important. EXAMPLE: In 2019, a natural-gas provider was hit with a judgment for some $9 million for fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation, because (the court found) the provider had recklessly represented to a customer that the provider had certain capabilities, when the provider "did not do any investigation as to whether [it] could satisfy this obligation &#x2026;."<sup><a id="fnr.RainboMistr" class="footref" href="#fn.RainboMistr" role="doc-backlink">36</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Here's a hypothetical example: Suppose that Ginger is selling Fred a used car that she has been keeping in a garage in another city; she wants to <i>represent</i>, but not <i>warrant</i>, that the car is in good working order.  She could phrase her representation in one of two basic ways:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <i>Phrasing 1:</i> Ginger says, "I represent that the car is in good working order." Under <a href="#r-rep-defn">22.34</a>, Ginger is <i>implicitly</i> making an ancillary representation, namely that she has a reasonable basis for her main representation that the car is in good working order, perhaps because she recently drove it or had it checked out by a mechanic.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <i>Phrasing 2:</i> "<i>So far as I know</i>, the car is in good working order." By using the phrase <i>so far as I know</i>, Ginger should be held to have implicitly <i>disclaimed</i> any such ancillary representation.
</p>

<p>
(Ginger could make the disclaimer of Phrasing 2 even strongly by saying, for example: "So far as I know, the car is in good working order, <i>but it's been sitting in the garage for years and I have no idea what kind of shape it's in</i>.")

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-rep-to-my-knowl">
<p>
Some representations use phrasing such as "<i>to [party name's] knowledge</i>, X is true" — this is unwise, in the present author's view, because it could be argued to mean that the representing party is implicitly representing that it does indeed <i>have</i> knowledge that X is true. That argument should not prevail, but (to paraphrase a former student) that's a conversation we don't want to have.

Likewise, in some other English-speaking countries, in some contexts the term <i>shall</i> might be construed as tentative or optional, not as mandatory. <cite> See, e.g., a <a href="https://www.pco.govt.nz/making-secondary-legislation/secondary-legislation-drafting-toolkit/how-to-draft/using-plain-language">New Zealand legislative drafting guide</a> ("'Shall' is less and less commonly used, partly because it is difficult to use correctly.

FACTS:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"Buyer" and "Seller" have entered into a master purchase agreement ("MPA").</li>

<li>Under the MPA, Buyer can send purchase orders to Seller, <i>at steeply-discounted pricing,</i> but that pricing lasts only until December 31.</li>

<li>On December 31, Seller leaves work at her usual quitting time of 6:00 p.m. (Let's assume that Buyer and Seller are in the same time zone.)</li>

<li>That evening, Buyer emails a purchase order to Seller, stating the discounted pricing.  Seller's email system records Buyer's email as having arrived at 11:59 p.m.</li>

<li>Neither Buyer nor Seller go to work or check their emails on New Year's Day.</li>

<li>On January <i>2</i>, Seller sees Buyer's purchase-order email for the first time; she emails Buyer to say, <i>sorry, you're too late, your steep discount expired, and the higher pricing applies</i>.</li>

<li>Buyer is not happy and complains about it; Seller isn't happy to have to deal with a disgruntled customer.</li>
</ol>

<p>
QUESTION 1: Should Buyer get the steeply-discounted price?
</p>

<p>
QUESTION 2: Could the MPA drafters have averted this situation — and the resulting dent in the parties' business relationship?

<p>
A.&nbsp; Given the costs likely to be associated with arbitration, it makes sense to allow "small" claims to be heard in small-claims courts, created by state law, which are generally less costly than courts of "general jurisdiction," for example, by allowing a company to be represented by a non-lawyer.
</p>

<p>
Generally, small-claims courts are allowed by law to hear only cases where the amount in controversy is no more than a specified "jurisdictional limit"; at this writing, the limit is $10,000 in <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/smallclaims/general.shtml">New York</a> and <a href="https://www.courts.ca.gov/9617.htm">California</a> and $20,000 in <a href="https://guides.sll.texas.gov/small-claims">Texas</a>.

B.&nbsp; Subdivision 3: It'd be unfair for one party, after participating in arbitration, to do an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Litella">Emily Litella</a> and say, "Never mind!" forcing the other party to shift gears to working on a small-claims lawsuit instead — likely with duplicated effort.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 4 — no power: See <a href="#nl-ArbAppFed">23.1.33.15</a>.  Arguably, an arbitrator shouldn't be the one to determine whether a small-claims election is valid — that's because the arbitrator would likely have a financial interest in keeping the case in arbitration.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="orgc407753"></a> The American retailer missed (what an American court found to be) a crucial deadline in a payment-dispute arbitration with a Chinese manufacturer. Why? Because the Chinese manufacturer's notice of the demand for arbitration had been <i>in Chinese</i> — even though the parties' agreement and their previous dealings had all been in English.</li>

<li>The Chinese manufacturer won the arbitration and sought to enforce the arbitration award in a Colorado court.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The American retailer caught a break: The Colorado court refused to <a href="#nl-arb-confirm">confirm</a> the resulting arbitration award — even though normally the court likely would have done so as a matter of routine — on grounds that the Chinese-language notice of the arbitration was not reasonably calculated to apprise the retailer of the arbitration proceedings; an appellate court affirmed. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14473561382045258172">CEEG (Shanghai) Solar Science & Tech.

A.&nbsp; The "seat" of the arbitration: See <a href="#nl-arb-seat">23.1.32.5</a>.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/CommercialRules_Web_1.pdf">Commercial Arbitration Rules</a> of the American Arbitration Association are a typical "default" standard in the U.S.; the AAA also has: &bull; rules for expedited cases; &bull; rules for appeals of arbitrator awards to an <i>appellate panel</i> of arbitrators; and &bull; special rules for consumer arbitrations.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; For <i>consumer</i> arbitration, the AAA has a special set of rules — but those rules require the parties' arbitration agreement to comply (or be modified to comply) with the AAA's due-process standards, failing which the AAA can decline to accept the arbitration and either party can go to court. EXAMPLE: A company found itself in court, instead of in arbitration, when the company rejected the AAA's request that the company modify its <i>consumer</i> arbitration agreement to remove a damages limitation. The AAA thereupon declined to accept the case, as provided in the AAA's relevant rules — which left the consumer-plaintiff free to pursue litigation in court. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5013551834509404153">Hernandez v. MicroBilt Corp.</a>, 88 F.4th 215 (3d Cir. 2023) (affirming denial of motion to compel arbitration). </cite>

C.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: English procedural law is very-commonly used for transnational arbitrations.
</p>

<p>
Fun fact: According to one Second-Circuit panel, it'd supposedly be unusual, indeed "exceedingly rare," for an arbitration agreement to designate an arbitration <i>procedural</i> law that was different from that of the arbitration venue. That, though, might well strike some experienced arbitrators as contrary to what they've seen in practice — for example, English arbitral law is routinely agreed to for international arbitrations even when the arbitration <i>proceedings</i> are to be conducted elsewhere. <cite> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/24-2209/24-2209-2025-07-02.html">Molecular Dynamics, Ltd. v. Spectrum Dynamics Med. Ltd.</a>, 143 F.4th 70, 83 n.10 (2d Cir. 2025) (affirming dismissal of petition to enforce arbitration award; arbitration agreement's choice of enforcement forum doesn't confer subject-matter jurisdiction). </cite>

<p>
For emphasis: The parties' agreement to arbitration rules is a choice of <i>rules</i>, not of forum. This means, for example, that arbitration would still be required even if the organization promulgating those rules were to decline to participate in the Arbitration.

A.&nbsp; Subdivision 1 — "seat" of the arbitration: See <a href="#nl-arb-seat">23.1.32.5</a>.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Arbitration requires a number of administrative chores such as scheduling of calls and hearings, etc. It's usually more cost-effective for an institution to handle such administrative chores than it would be for the arbitrator to charge for his- or her time to do so.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Experienced arbitrator <a href="https://www.mcgowan-adr.com/">Gary McGowan</a> — previously a founding name partner of leading national litigation boutique Susman & McGowan, now Susman Godfrey LLP — points out some other advantages of using an arbitration administrator such as the AAA:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"AAA's vetting process formalizes disclosures of potential conflicts/biases and thus minimizes <i>[sic; reduces]</i> the likelihood of a flawed proceeding."</li>

<li>In addition, a party might have a complaint about an arbitrator, for example a perception that the arbitrator is biased toward another party. It will usually be better if the complaining party can take its complaint to an arbitral institution, than to risk angering the arbitrator by raising the complaint with the arbitrator himself.</li>

<li>And "a competent administrator will goad an arbitrator who is not moving the proceeding apace." <cite> <a href="https://www.mcgowan-adr.com/">Gary McGowan</a>, <a href="http://www.law.com/corporatecounsel/PubArticleCC.jsp?id=1202596761854">12 Ways to Achieve Efficiency and Speed in Arbitration</a>, Corporate Counsel (Apr. 22, 2013) (now paywalled). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
D.&nbsp; And according to <a href="https://www.sherby.co.il/pdf/BLT_A_Checklist_For_Drafting.pdf">Sherby</a> (2010), "the conventional wisdom is that it is easier to enforce an award given by an arbitral institution than one given by an ad hoc arbitrator" — this makes a certain sense, because, in the eyes of a court, the involvement of a known-quantity arbitral institution would likely give an arbitration proceeding and award a bit of extra legitimacy.
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; In the U.S., a commonly-used administrator is the <a href="http://www.adr.org/">American Arbitration Association</a> ("AAA") or its international division, the <a href="https://www.icdr.org/">International Centre for Dispute Resolution</a>; other arbitration-administration organizations are also available. (Disclosure: For some ten years I served on the AAA's panel of commercial arbitrators.) 
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; A number of arbitration-administration organizations are available, such as: &bull; <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS</a>; &bull; the <a href="https://drs.cpradr.org/?utm_source=novi+menu">International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution</a> (CPR); &bull; the <a href="http://www.lcia.org/">London Court of International Arbitration</a> (LCIA); &bull; the <a href="http://www.iccwbo.org/about-icc/organization/dispute-resolution-services/icc-international-court-of-arbitration/">International Court of Arbitration</a> of the International Chamber of Commerce.

<p>
G.&nbsp; For international arbitrations, according to <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/arbitration/media/arbitration/docs/LON0320037-QMUL-International-Arbitration-Survey-2021_19_WEB.pdf#page=4.29/">a 2021 survey</a> by Queen Mary University of London and the U.S.-based international law firm White & Case LLP (2021), the five most preferred arbitral institutions are the ICC; Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC); Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC); LCIA; and China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC).

A.&nbsp; Three arbitrators are likely to be <i>more</i> than three times as expensive as just one. That's because three arbitrators will necessarily spend (billable) time conferring with each other, reviewing drafts of written decisions, etc.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>But:</b> For some cases, the reassurance of having three arbitrators, reducing the chances of one arbitrator "going rogue," could be worth the added expense. That could be especially true in view of the limited appealability of arbitration awards (discussed at <a href="#nl-ArbAppFed">23.1.33.15</a>).
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Under typical arbitration rules:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  A multi-member arbitration panel would designate, by majority vote, one of their number as the panel chair. 
</p>

<p>
(Majority vote is typical of arbitration rules for panel decisions; see, e.g., AAA <a href="https://www.adr.org/media/qielmf0g/2025_commercialrules_web.pdf#page=30.78">Rule R-46</a> and <a href="https://www.lcia.org/Dispute_Resolution_Services/LCIA_Arbitration_Rules.aspx#article26">LCIA Rule 26.3</a>.)
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The chair would have the power to resolve any procedural disputes without consulting the full panel — absent objection by any party or by any other member of the panel.
</p>

<p>
(Allowing the chair of the arbitration panel to decide procedural disputes is based on concepts from AAA <a href="https://www.adr.org/media/qielmf0g/2025_commercialrules_web.pdf#page=30.78">Rule R-46</a> (which are a bit convoluted); for that reason, some parties might prefer to follow <a href="https://www.lcia.org/Dispute_Resolution_Services/LCIA_Arbitration_Rules.aspx#article5">LCIA Rule 5.6</a> (which calls for the chair to be appointed by the LCIA).)

Arbitration rules usually call for a single arbitrator to be independent and impartial, e.g., under the AAA's <a href="https://www.adr.org/media/qielmf0g/2025_commercialrules_web.pdf#page=21.19">Commercial Rule R-19</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, parties agree that each party will appoint one <i>non</i>-neutral arbitrator and a third arbitrator will be neutral; see, e.g., AAA <a href="https://www.adr.org/media/qielmf0g/2025_commercialrules_web.pdf#page=21.19">Rule R-19(b)</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Rarely — if the parties have so agreed — a single, <i>non</i>-neutral arbitrator will decide the case, as happens in some professional sports collective-bargaining agreements that provide for a senior authority figure <i>in one of the parties</i> to serve as arbitrator; such an arbitrator arguably would not be neutral. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In the <i>Deflategate</i> case, which centered on legendary (U.S.) National Football League quarterback Tom Brady: The court <b>rejected</b> Brady's objection to having NFL commissioner Roger Goodell sit as the arbitrator in Brady's challenge of his four-game suspension. The court held, in essence, that the players' union and the team owners had known full well the consequences of their arbitration agreement and that they could have bargained to do things differently. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3969574590923650874">NFL Mgmt. Council v. NFL Players Ass'n</a>, 820 F.3d 527, 548 (2d Cir. 2016) (reversing district court judgment and remanding with instructions to confirm award confirming disciplinary action against Brady). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: More than two decades early, New York's highest court held that under state law, the state's public policy doesn't prohibit an alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provision that authorizes an employee of a party to a contract dispute — in that case, an employee of a particular city agency — to make "conclusive, final, and binding decisions on all questions arising under the contract," even when the employee was personally involved in the dispute:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Westinghouse chose, with its business eyes open, to accept the terms, specifications and risk of the bid contract, including the ADR clause. &#x2026; Without doubt, Westinghouse understood the implications of the ADR clause prior to undertaking its business and legal risks under the whole of the multimillion dollar agreement. To allow it, after the fact, to secure the assistance and power of the courts to relieve it of a particular procedural provision, while retaining the benefits of the rest of the publicly bid public works contract, is not compelled by our precedents and would have destabilizing commercial law consequences. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4682930253529396010">Westinghouse Elec.

The court distinguished the <i>Deflategate</i> ruling because "[t]here, we conducted a very limited review of an arbitration award under the Labor Management Relations Act, not the FAA. The rights at issue <i>[there]</i> were contractual, not federal statutory rights, and they were subject to arbitration according to the terms of a collectively bargained for arbitration agreement."

<b>Counterexample:</b> <a id="orgdc1018e"></a> In a professional-boxing case, the First Circuit held that, under the applicable Puerto Rican law, the arbitration provision in the World Boxing Organization's agreement with boxers was unconscionable because it gave the WBO the power to select the arbitrator.

On appeal, with the bar's agreement but over the employee's objection, the appeals court directed the trial court to choose an arbitrator, as provided by the Federal Arbitration Act, and to order the parties to arbitrate. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8318327590471206662">Campbell v.

A.&nbsp; In the typical selection process, the arbitration administrator (e.g., the AAA) presents the parties with a list of candidates and for parties to strike unacceptable candidates; this is seen in, e.g., AAA Commercial <a href="https://www.adr.org/media/qielmf0g/2025_commercialrules_web.pdf#page=18.53">Rule R-13</a>.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Absent a <i>backup</i> method for selecting an arbitrator, a court might refuse to compel arbitration if the agreed selection method failed — at this writing, that's the subject of a circuit split among U.S. federal courts. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11158198837680753640">Frazier v.

<p>
C.&nbsp; Arbitrators would generally have the qualifications specified in the arbitration rules; if an arbitration administrator is used (e.g., the AAA), the administrator will typically maintain a pre-screened roster of neutral arbitrators.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; But the Con&shy;tract could specify particular qualifications, and even different arbitrator qualifications for different types of dispute. EXAMPLE: In one Tenth Circuit case, the parties' arbitration agreement specified different arbitrator qualifications for <i>energy-related</i> disputes versus <i>accounting</i> disputes. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8193281651995428334">BP America Product. v.

<div id="outline-container-orgae5b156" class="outline-6 cmtry">
<h6 id="orgae5b156">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgae5b156">
<p>
A.&nbsp; The word "<b>WAIVE</b>" is in bold-faced all-caps for conspicuousness (see <a href="#consp-cmt">30.1</a>) as "<a href="#nl-ch-ins">cheap insurance</a>" in case there's a conspicuousness requirement for jury waivers that would apply to arbitration agreements.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp;  Background: Juries aren't used in arbitration. And <i>outside</i> the arbitration context, <i>advance</i> waivers of jury trials are very likely to be held unenforceable in California, Georgia, and North Carolina, as explained at <a href="#nl-jury-waiv-top">23.15.4</a>. Consequently, there have been cases where a party, no longer willing to arbitrate, has tried to set aside a <i>pre-dispute</i> arbitration agreement (e.g., in an employment agreement) on grounds that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable..
</p>

<p>
But where the Federal Arbitration Act applied, the Act would arguably preempt any state-law prohibitions of advance jury waivers. This thinking comes from the Supreme Court's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3870951188038012616">Concepcion</a> (2011) opinion, where the Court held that federal law preempted a California supreme court decision that declared arbitration provisions in certain cases to be unenforceable if they did not allow for classwide arbitration. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3870951188038012616">AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion</a>, 563 U.S. 333, 131 S. Ct. 1740 (2011). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Nevada supreme court held that the Federal Arbitration Act did indeed preempt a state statute imposing certain requirements on arbitration agreements. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4930663900268165287">MMAWC, LLC v. Zion Wood Obi Wan Trust</a>, 135 Nev. Adv. Op. 38, 448 P.3d 568 (2019). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> New Jersey's supreme court held that an arbitration provision was unenforceable because the provision did not expressly waive jury trial; to the surprise of some observers (including me), the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the losing side's appeal. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8116499973280355897">Atalese v. US Legal Serv. Group, LLP</a>, 219 N.J. 430 99 A.3d 306 (2014). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Tangentially: In an Uber-related case, a Pennsylvania appeals court ruled — perhaps with an eye to just such a federal-preemption argument — that state law required <i>all</i> jury-trial waivers (not just those in arbitration agreements) to be supported by a showing that the waiving party had "unambiguously manifested [its] assent" to the waiver. Consequently, said the court, an arbitration provision in "browse-wrap" terms of service, used by ride-sharing service Uber, was unenforceable. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2028066304084728162">Chilutti v.

<p>
Unless the parties to the Arbitration clearly agree otherwise: In addition to any other limits stated in this Protocol (or elsewhere in the Con&shy;tract), the arbitrator has <a href="#nl-ArbAppFed">no power</a> to do any of the following things: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>grant relief clearly inconsistent with the Con&shy;tract or with applicable non-arbitration law; nor</li>

<li>render an award that would be subject to being reversed or vacated, on one or more grounds, if rendered as a judgment by a United States district court following a trial to the court without a jury; nor</li>

<li>act as <i>amiable compositeur</i> or <i>ex aequo et bono</i>.</li>

<h6 id="org4c62d4f">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org4c62d4f">
<p>
A.&nbsp; There's a perception in some quarters that arbitrators can run amok, i.e., "go rogue." Part of this comes from the traditional doctrine that arbitrators are allowed to act as "<i>amiable compositeur</i>" and "<i>ex aequo et bono</i>," referring to the arbitrator's deciding the case "according to the equitable and good" — as perceived <i>by the arbitrator</i>, of course.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Some observers believed that the arbitrators went too far in a software-copyright dispute between competitors IBM and Fujitsu — in that case, the arbitrators ultimately ordered IBM to provide its operating-system source code and other secret information to Fujitsu; and ordered <i>Fujitsu</i> to pay significant money to IBM for the privilege. <cite> See David E. Sanger, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/16/business/fight-ends-for-ibm-and-fujitsu.html">Fight Ends For I.B.M. And Fujitsu</a>, NY Times, Sept. 16, 1987. For more background on that IBM-Fujitsu dispute, see a student note: Anita Stork, <a href="http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/btlj/vol3/iss2/3.">The Use of Arbitration in Copyright Disputes: IBM v. Fujitsu</a>, 3 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 241 (1988). (<a href="https://www.cov.com/en/professionals/s/anita-stork">Ms. Stork</a> is now a prominent antitrust litigator.) </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; And worse, under U.S. law, the opportunities to appeal an adverse arbitration award could be very limited unless the agreement to arbitration limits the arbitrator's power (see the notes at <a href="#ArbEnhApp">23.1.26</a> for additional discussion of that point). 
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; DCT comment: From what I've seen, most arbitrators seem to stick to the law and the contract. Not least, that's because — wanting to be hired again and to get referrals from satisfied counsel — <b>arbitrators can be reluctant to anger either side's counsel</b>, which could happe if they render an award that doesn't make sense to the losing counsel. <cite> See Thomas J. Stipanowich, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1297526">Arbitration: The New Litigation</a>, 2010 Ill. L. Rev. 1. </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> Instead of <i>cabining</i> the arbitrator's power, consider expressly <span class="underline">allowing</span> the arbitrator to act as <i>amiable compositeur</i> and <i>ex aequo et bono</i>. (But many parties won't want to agree to that in advance before they know who the arbitrator will be, so this section contemplates delaying that decision.)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-arb-enf">
<p>
Once the arbitrator has issued any award in the Arbitration, any party can go to court to confirm the award, and to have the resulting court judgment (or order) judicially enforced against another party, in any court that has "jurisdiction" (i.e., the legal authority to hear the case) over the subject matter and the other party. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-nl-arb-confirm" class="outline-6 cmtry">
<h6 id="nl-arb-confirm">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-nl-arb-confirm">
<p>
A.&nbsp; By law, arbitration awards "are not self-enforcing and must be given force and effect by being converted to judicial orders by courts; these orders can confirm and/or vacate the award, either in whole or in part." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13666945940544116533">D.H. Blair & Co., Inc. v. Gottdiener</a>, 462 F.3d 95, 104 (2d Cir. 2006) (cleaned up). </cite>
</p>

<p>
To illustrate, here's a hypothetical situation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Alice" agrees to arbitrate a dispute with "Bob" over whether Alice owes Bob money.</li>

<li>The arbitrator decides in Bob's favor and rules that Alice must pay Bob, let's say, $1,000.</li>

<li>Alice refuses to pay Bob as directed by the arbitrator's award.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, Bob can't just stroll into Alice's bank and ask a teller to hand him $1,000 from Alice's account: Bob must instead go to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a court in a jurisdiction where Alice can lawfully be sued anyway (i.e., Alice is "subject to personal jurisdiction" there); OR</li>

<li>a court in a jurisdiction where Alice has <i>agreed</i> that she can be sued <i>and</i> that otherwise has "subject-matter jurisdiction" to hear Bob's case.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Whichever court that is: Bob will ask the judge (with no jury) to "confirm" the award under the Federal Arbitration Act (in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9">Title 9</a> of the U.S. Code) or, in international cases, by treaty (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Recognition_and_Enforcement_of_Foreign_Arbitral_Awards">New York Convention</a>). 
</p>

<p>
Alice, on the other hand, will likely ask the judge to vacate the award.
</p>

<p>
Assuming Bob succeeds in getting the judge to confirm the award and enter judgment: Bob can have that judgment "executed" — that is, <i>then</i> Bob can get law-enforcement authorities to confiscate enough of Alice's money and other assets to satisfy the judgment.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Some arbitration provisions address which court(s) will have such power, perhaps with language such as the following:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org90a1347">
<p>
Any arbitration award under the Con&shy;tract may be confirmed and enforced <i>[only?]</i> in a court having jurisdiction in <i>[fill in location]</i>.
</p>

</div>

<p>
This is a type of forum-selection provision; for more on that subject generally, see Protocol <a href="#r-forum-sel">23.11</a>.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> State law might provide that agreement <i>to arbitrate</i> in the state constitutes consent to jurisdiction — or even <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction — in the courts of the state to enter judgment on the arbitration award; moreover, such a statute might purport to confer <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction in the courts of that state. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1293.&nodeTreePath=6.8.5.2&lawCode=CCP">Cal. Code of Civ. P. § 1293</a> (consent to jurisdiction); <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_909.htm#sec_52-407zz">Conn. Gen. Stat. § 52-407zz(b)</a>; <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-038.html#NRS038Sec244">Nev. Rev. Stat. § 38.244</a> (<i>exclusive</i> juriscdiction). </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b> A <i>federal</i> district court can confirm an arbitration award only if — on the face of the confirmation petition itself — the court has an independent basis for subject-matter jurisdiction such as diversity of the parties; it's not enough that the Federal Arbitration Act applies. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2763001348087772049">Badgerow v. Walters</a>, 596 U.S. 1, 142 S. Ct. 1310 (2022) (FAA doesn't independently confer subject-matter jurisdiction). </cite>
</p>

<p>
For that reason, if diversity is indeed the only basis for subject-matter jurisdiction, then a federal court has no power to confirm an arbitration award of zero dollars (i.e., a "defense verdict" award) because the required amount in controversy for diversity jurisdiction won't be met. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1537048175687213954">Tesla Motors, Inc. v. Balan</a>, 134 F.4th 558 (9th Cir. 2025) (vacating order confirming "defense verdict" award in favor of Tesla and remanding with instructions to dismiss). </cite>
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Relatedly: In 2025 the Second Circuit held that an arbitration agreement's choice of <i>enforcement</i> forum doesn't confer subject-matter jurisdiction for federal district court to <i>vacate</i> an award. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4207656876236128533">Molecular Dynamics, Ltd. v. Spectrum Dynamics Med. Ltd.</a>, 143 F.4th 70 No. 24-2209, slip op. at 31-35 (2d Cir. Jul. 2, 2025) (affirming dismissal of petition to vacate arbitration award). </cite>

Depending on the wording of the arbitration requirement, there's case law going both ways about whether the arbitration requirement would survive if the contract containing the requirement were to expire or be terminated. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6886459522771379043">Vazquez v.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Especially in consumer- and employment cases, counsel for claimants in arbitration sometimes try to consolidate claims and handle them as they would a class-action lawsuit. That can make economic sense for all concerned — but it can be tricky in view of Supreme Court holdings.
</p>

<p>
Specifically: In the Supreme Court's 2010 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10710331230598206156">Stolt-Nielsen</a> opinion by Justice Alito, the Court held that <i>class</i> arbitration is <b>not permitted</b> under the Federal Arbitration Act unless the parties <b>expressly</b> agreed to it, because "class-action arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator." The Court went on to catalog ways in which class arbitration differs from the traditional, one-on-one variety. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10710331230598206156">Stolt-Nielsen SA v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp.</a>, 559 U.S. 662, 130 S. Ct. 1758, 1775-76 (2010) (Alito, J.). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: It's very likely better for a judge, not an arbitrator, to decide whether <i>class</i> arbitration is or isn't allowed by an arbitration agreement. That's because, if <i>the arbitrator</i> gets to decide whether the parties agreed to class-action arbitration, then the arbitrator might well have a personal incentive to err on the side of "finding" that class arbitration was indeed agreed to — and there'd likely be little recourse in court to try to get such a finding reversed.
</p>

<p>
But under the (U.S.) Federal Arbitration Act, one of the very-few grounds on which a federal court may vacate an award in arbitration is that "the arbitrators exceeded their powers &#x2026;." under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9/10">9 U.S.C. § 10</a>(a)(4). (See also Option <a href="#ArbEnhApp">23.1.26</a>, providing for enhanced appeal of an arbitration award.)
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, arbitrators have been known to "find" an agreement to class arbitration even though the contract said nothing of the sort — I've personally seen that happen, albeit not in any case I was involved in  — yet still have the "finding" be upheld by a reviewing court, as though <i>Stolt-Nielsen</i> had never been decided. 
</p>

<p>
In all likelihood, such an arbitrator genuinely wants to help the parties resolve <i>all</i> of the pending claims quickly and fairly. But you can see the obvious conflict of interest here:  By "finding" agreement to <i>class</i> arbitration, the arbitrator will get more work, for a longer time, and bill more fees, than for doing just one, single-party arbitration, and so the arbitrator has an economic incentive to make such a "finding."
</p>

<p>
And under the Supreme Court's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12985390297990950310">Oxford Health Plans</a> decision, if an arbitration agreement <i>delegates to the arbitrator</i> the decision whether class arbitration is allowed, then the arbitrator's decision about class-action arbitrability <i>can't be overruled by a court</i> except on extremely-limited grounds.  
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: An arbitration provision in an employment agreement — drafted by the employer's counsel, of course — authorized arbitration of "all remedies which might be available in court." An arbitrator interpreted this language as <i>implicitly</i> allowing <i>class</i> arbitration, largely on grounds that "[t]he breadth of claims the agreement covered, compared to the relatively few it exempted, suggested to the arbitrator that the parties made a conscious choice not to exclude class arbitration." Upholding a lower court's confirmation of the award, the Fifth Circuit held that "<b>whatever the merits of the arbitrator's analysis here, it is enough that he focused on the arbitration clause's text</b>, analyzing (<b>whether correctly or not makes no difference</b>) the scope of both what it barred from court and what it sent to arbitration." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10721669599675419896">Sun Coast Resources, Inc. v. Conrad</a>, 956 F.3d 335, 337-38 (5th Cir. 2020) (cleaned up, emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
So: Instead of leaving the class-arbitration decision power open to debate, this Option <i>expressly</i> takes that power out of the arbitrator's hands — in part to <i>perhaps</i> provide grounds on which a court could vacate an arbitrator's decision.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> This Option's prohibition of class-action arbitration might be unenforceable if used to try to prevent class-action relief authorized by statute, e.g., under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8366930111107016851">Williams v. Shapiro</a>, No. 24-11192, part III.B, <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca11/24-11192/24-11192-2025-12-15.pdf#page=13">slip op. at 13-17</a> (11th Cir. Dec. 15, 2025) (affirming denial of defendants' motion to compel arbitration of ERISA claims in lieu of class-action litigation; citing cases from other circuits). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-nl-arb-del">
<p>
A.&nbsp; For the arbitrator to have the power to decide <i>arbitrability</i> disputes, the arbitration agreement itself must clearly and unmistakably delegate <i>those specific decisions</i> to the arbitrator, said the Supreme Court. When that happens, the arbitrator will decide the arbitrability question — and a court will likely defer to the arbitrator's decision on that point. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2717778595314053137">First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan</a>, 514 U.S. 938, 942 (1995) (reversing court of appeals and holding that agreement in question did not give arbitrator power to determine arbitrability); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7439299649204721585">Berkeley Cty. School Dist. v. HUB Int'l Ltd</a>., 130 F.4th 396, 403 (4th Cir. 2025) (reversing district court and remanding with instructions to compel arbitration). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Many arbitration rules include a delegation provision: if an arbitration agreement adopts such rules, then the delegation agreement <i>might</i> follow automatically. <cite> See, e.g., (what is now) Rule R-7(a) of the American Arbitration Association's <a href="https://go.adr.org/rs/294-SFS-516/images/CommercialRules_Web.pdf">Commercial Arbitration Rules</a>, a previous version of which were the agreed rules in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5983761559418018897">Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc.</a>, 586 U.S. 63 (2019), <i>on remand,</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8157625277493576275">935 F.3d 274</a>, 283 (5th Cir. 2019) (holding that "the parties have not clearly and unmistakably delegated the question of arbitrability to an arbitrator"), <i>cert. dismissed as improvidently granted</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16640184093344921557">592 U.S. 168</a> (2021); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4811284305254505900">Wu v. Uber Technologies, Inc.</a>, 43 N.Y.3d 288, 260 N.E.3d 1060 (2024) (affirming denial of motion to stay arbitration and affirmance of order compelling arbitration) (citing <i>Henry Schein, Inc.</i>). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; On the other hand: If there are <i>two</i> arguably-conflicting agreements — one that requires all controversies to be heard in a particular court, the other that contains an arbitration provision — then <i>a court</i> will determine which agreement controls on that point. This came up in a case where sweepstakes rules contained an exclusive forum-selection clause while the associated online terms of service required arbitration — this illustrates the importance of careful drafting. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9133873048963700507">Coinbase, Inc. v. Suski</a>, 602 U. S. 143 (2024) (affirming 9th Circuit). </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <i>But:</i> If a party claims that it never agreed to arbitration in the first place, then the arbitration clause's adoption of particular arbitration <i>rules</i> won't be enough to delegate the arbitrability dispute. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17464794362485547268">VIP, Inc. v. KYB Corp.</a>, 951 F.3d 377, 385-86 (6th Cir. 2020) (affirming denial of motion to compel arbitration). </cite>
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; And if the arbitration agreement itself refers only to <i>specified</i> disputes and not to <i>all</i> disputes, or if that agreement includes carve-outs, then a court might find that the agreement does <i>not</i> "clearly and unmistakably" delegate <i>arbitrability</i> decisions — even when the agreed arbitration <i>rules</i> might suggest otherwise. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/24-40323/24-40323-2025-12-18.html">Aramark Services Inc.

Williams-Sonoma, Inc.</a>, 6 F.4th 308, 319-21 (2d Cir. 2021) (same). </cite>
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; A party's too-extensive participation in court proceedings could result in a waiver of its right to demand arbitration. This happened in a case between the founder of the Papa John's pizza chain and the chain's former public-relations in connection with the founder's departure after making highly-publicized comments. (Unusually, the Sixth Circuit framed the issue in terms of the PR firm's having "defaulted on its right to arbitrate disputes &#x2026;.") <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2797416238182647203">Schnatter v. 247 Group, LLC</a>, 155 F.4th 543, 555 (6th Cir. 2025) (affirming denial of defendant's motion to compel arbitration); <i>see also id.</i> at 551 n.3 (reframing the waiver issue as one of default) (citations omitted). </cite>

G.&nbsp; Subdivision 2 — <b>caution:</b> A court might hold that <i>the delegation agreement</i> was <b>unconscionable</b>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5237347192572000094">Heckman v.

</p>

<p>
And <i>some</i> states do allow parties also to agree on expanded appeal rights in arbitration; this section takes advantage of that possibility by allowing reversal or vacating of an arbitrator's action on the same basis as for a non-jury trial ("bench trial") in the U.S.

A.&nbsp; This Option addresses the fear among some lawyers that an arbitrator might go overboard in awarding "punies," given the relatively-few opportunities there'd be to appeal such an award (see Option <a href="#ArbEnhApp">23.1.26</a>). <cite> For similar language, see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4666833752093186280">Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.

<p>
Unless specifically required by law, it's <b>not a great idea</b> to include separate lines for a separate signature (or initials) for an arbitration agreement. That's because it's too easy for a party to forget — or intentionally fail — to sign or initial there. That could lead to a dispute about whether the party <i>in fact</i> agreed to the arbitration provision — which in turn could lead to costly litigation, perhaps with unpredictable outcomes. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14211014124843748612">Mertens v.

<p>
The body of an oil-and-gas lease included an arbitration provision that was seemingly negated by a provision in an exhibit to the lease, which stated:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
If any of the following provisions conflict with or are inconsistent with the printed provisions or terms of this Lease, <b>the following provisions shall control</b>. * * *
</p>

<p>
22.  All Disputes Decided in Harrison County Courts — <b>All</b> disputes the parties are unable to resolve between themselves <b>shall be subject to a civil lawsuit</b>. The Courts in Harrison County, Ohio (Common Pleas and County) shall have <b>exclusive jurisdiction</b> over <b>all</b> disputes. Neither party shall be able to either file or remove a case to Federal Court. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
A trial court denied a motion to compel arbitration, reasoning that the exhibit language meant what it said. But the state supreme court disagreed, asserting that "[a]n arbitration clause and a forum selection clause are not necessarily mutually exclusive because <b>arbitration and litigation are not mutually exclusive</b>." (Emphasis mine.) The court distinguished another case in which an addendum had explicitly <i>ruled out arbitration</i>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12240226843487242540">Denham v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-23-1-32-4">
<p>
EXAMPLE: In Texas, if a contract relates broadly to real property located in Texas and is entered into after September 1, 2025, then (with certain exceptions) an arbitration provision that requires arbitration in another state is void as against public policy — ditto for forum-selection clauses requiring litigation in the courts of another state, and governing-law provisions that choose the law of another state. <cite> See <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.272.htm#272">Tex.

<h5 id="nl-arb-seat"><span class="section-number-5">23.1.32.5.</span> What's the "seat" of the arbitration?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-arb-seat">
<p>
The "seat" of an arbitration is the geographic location where legally the arbitration is deemed to take place (even though many arbitrations are done by videoconference or, if in person, in other convenient locations).  The seat of an arbitration can have significant procedural implications, such as in determining the arbitral law.
</p>

<p>
The seat of an arbitration is often agreed upon by the parties. But it might not make sense to lock down the arbitration seat in advance, because that's a decision that might be better negotiated in the actual event. 
</p>

<p>
(If disputing parties can't agree on an arbitration location, the arbitration <i>rules</i> might well specify how the location is to be determined.)
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="https://arbitration.qmul.ac.uk/research/2021-international-arbitration-survey/">a 2021 survey</a> by Queen Mary University of London and the U.S.-based international law firm White & Case LLP, "[t]he five most preferred seats for arbitration are London, Singapore, Hong Kong, Paris and Geneva." 
</p>

<p>
Three Hong Kong-based lawyers assert that that their city is well-suited as a seat for arbitration with companies in China (PRC) because: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Uniquely among Chinese cities, Hong Kong retains its common-law system;</li>

<li>Judicial filing fees don't increase with the amount of the claim; and</li>

<li>"Given its status as a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and as a separate jurisdiction from Mainland China, Hong Kong is in the unique position of being the only jurisdiction outside of Mainland China to have a number of mutual arrangements with Mainland China for judicial assistance covering various aspects of civil and commercial disputes." <cite> Sherlin Tung, Alex Ye, and Gary Leung, <a href="https://www.withersworldwide.com/en-gb/insight/read/why-hong-kong-remains-an-ideal-place-to-resolve-your-commercial-disputes">Why Hong Kong remains an ideal place to resolve your commercial disputes</a> (WithersWorldwide.com 2024).

</ul>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> Before agreeing to arbitrate in Hong Kong, parties and counsel would want to <i>carefully</i> consider the then-current geopolitical situation and assess the potential "pros and cons" of physically going to Hong Kong, not just from a business perspective but also from a <i>personal</i> standpoint.

In determining whether an arbitration provision is unconscionable, courts sometimes consider how <i>readable</i> the provision is.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <i>OTO, LLC</i> (2019): California's supreme court held that an arbitration agreement, signed by a service technician at a Toyota dealership, was unconscionable, and therefore unenforceable, because of the circumstances in which the technician was asked to sign the agreement and the agreement's virtually-unreadable formatting.  <small> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10641621054458655175">OTO, LLC v.

(The court rejected a dissenting justice's argument that federal law preempted state law on that point.)
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <i>Bowles</i> (2020): Addressing a slightly-different issue in another employment-arbitration case, the Fifth Circuit held that "[the employee's] procedural unconscionability challenge went to whether the Arbitration Agreement should be enforced rather than to whether an agreement had been formed between the parties.

OneMain Financial Group, LLC</a>, 954 F.3d 722, 726-27 (5th Cir. 2020) (affirming order compelling arbitration). </small>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <i>Domestic Linen Supply</i> (2020): A California appeals court held that the arbitration clause in suit "is invalid because the clause is as inconspicuous as a frog in a thicket of water lilies." In that case, the contract was a two-page printed form with the signature on the front; the "fine print" (literally) on the back was 17 paragraphs of <i>eight point</i> (!) type, numbered as paragraphs 5 through 21. <small> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13624731724855091536">Domestic Linen Supply Co. v. LJT Flowers, Inc.</a>, 58 Cal. App. 5th 180, 182, 184, 185 272 Cal. Rptr. 3d 291 (2020) (affirming denial of petition to compel arbitration).

</p>

<p>
<span style="font-size:8pt;">This is approximately what eight-point type looks like.</span>
</p>

<p>
The arbitration provision was paragraph 15 and contained "no heading, boldface, italics, or capitalization that would draw attention to it. It is simply hidden in a thicket of fine print." Moreover, "[t]he warning that the garments Domestic provides are not fire-resistant is in capitalized, boldface type, but not the provision waiving the purchaser's constitutional right to a jury trial."
</p>

<p>
<i>Counterexample:</i> California's supreme court held that a long, virtually-unreadable arbitration provision in tiny print — signed by an employee who'd been pressured into doing so quickly — exhibited "such a high degree of procedural unconscionability" that "even a low degree of substantive unconscionability may render the agreement unenforceable."  <a href="https://www4.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S280256.PDF">Fuentes v.

Not quite as horribly unreadable, but still containing several "<a href="#sssp">spaghetti clause</a>" paragraphs (see <a href="#sssp">32.3</a>) was the arbitration provision in <i>Basith</i> (2023), decided by the same panel of the California appeals court on the same day, and with the same dissent by the presiding justice. <small> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8386607931250430688">Basith v.

Drafters of online consumer- and employment contracts might want to try to plan for consumers and employees to claim that they couldn't read an arbitration provision because it was too tiny to read <i>on their smartphones</i>.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-arb-b2c">
<p>
Binding arbitration started out as a procedure to resolve disputes in business-to-<i>business</i> ("B2B") contracts. But arbitration requirements are increasingly found in business-to-<i>consumer</i> ("B2C") contracts — sometimes with terms that decidedly advantage the business.
</p>

<p>
Moreover (as discussed at <a href="#arb-pros-cons">23.1.33.3</a>), nowadays many drafters of <i>B2B</i> contracts seem to want to <i>avoid</i> arbitration because it's said to offer "the worst of both worlds," with most of the expense of litigation but without broad discovery rights and few avenues to appeal an adverse outcome.

Suppose we have the following situation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A vendor <i>purportedly</i> sends an email to a customer with terms and conditions for a sale.</li>

<li>The vendor's T&Cs include, among other things, a jury-trial waiver and arbitration clause.</li>

<li>The customer never responds to the email — but does proceed with the purchase.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Would the customer be bound by the jury waiver and arbitration clause as part of a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unilateral-contract.asp">unilateral contract</a>? EXAMPLE: In a New Jersey case, the state supreme court ruled that the answer <span class="underline">could</span> be yes — but the vendor (a cell-phone service provider) hadn't sufficiently proved that <span class="underline">in fact</span> it had sent the email to the customer. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17353416530816279695">Fazio v.

The Second Circuit affirmed, on grounds that "[(i)] the provider] failed to present the arbitration provision in a clear and conspicuous way, and [(ii)] a reasonable person would not have believed that <i>submitting payments</i> constituted assent."

<h5 id="arb-pros-cons"><span class="section-number-5">23.1.33.3.</span> Is arbitration really cheaper than a lawsuit?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-arb-pros-cons">
<p>
Some companies prefer arbitration over litigation because — when properly managed — arbitration <i>can</i> cost less money and take less time than court proceedings.  
</p>

<p>
(For arbitration-management suggestions, see my <a href="https://www.oncontracts.com/arbitration-streamlining/">arbitration streamlining article</a> — I sometimes serve as an arbitrator in tech-contract and IP disputes — as well as my preferred <a href="https://www.oncontracts.com/arb-procedures/">arbitration procedures</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Moreover, for transnational arbitrations: Because of the international treaty on arbitration (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Recognition_and_Enforcement_of_Foreign_Arbitral_Awards">New York Convention</a>), if a case is <i>arbitrated</i> in Country A, it's often easier for the winning party to get a court in Country B to enforce the arbitrator's award (e.g., by ordering seizure of the losing party's assets located in Country B) than it would be if the case had been <i>litigated</i> in Country A.
</p>

<p>
<b>But:</b> On the other hand, some parties regard arbitration as the worst of both worlds. Noted academic authority <a href="https://law.pepperdine.edu/faculty-research/thomas-stipanowich/">Tom Stipanowich</a> has suggested that — 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Arbitration has been "captured" by litigation counsel who, for reasons of their own, prefer to agree with their counterparts to run arbitration proceedings in the same expensive- and time-consuming ways as they're familiar with in court (that tracks with my own experience as an arbitrator); and</li>

<li>Arbitrators — mindful of getting <i>future</i> business and referrals from litigation counsel — can be reluctant to anger counsel in a case by overruling their procedural agreements, even though doing so would help to keep costs down in the case. <cite> See Thomas J.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-arb-empl-fee-wdraw">
<p>
If a company demands arbitration but then fails to pay related fees (e.g., from the American Arbitration Association or other institution), that could result in the company <b>being forced back into court for litigation — and possibly class-action litigation</b>.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A worker sued her former employer on several grounds. The company moved to compel arbitration. The parties initially agreed to a stay of the lawsuit pending arbitration. Later, the company was six days late in paying a third invoice for arbitration fees. This apparently was because the company's counsel had been caught up in an unspecified "natural disaster" that forced her and her family to evacuate their home. With a distinct lack of sympathy, the worker successfully moved to withdraw from arbitration and proceed with the lawsuit, as authorized by section 1281.98 of the state's code of civil procedure, so the company ended up in litigation after all. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4031966851359369239">Colon-Perez v. Security Indus. Specialists, Inc.</a>, 108 Cal. App. 5th 403, 409-10, 413, 421 & n.12, 329 Cal. Rptr. 3d 342 (2025) (affirming trial court's actions). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>BUT:</b> Just a few months later, in a 5-4 decision — based on harmonizing with nonforfeiture principles so as to avoid "equal footing" preemption by the Federal Arbitration Act — <b>California's supreme court expressly disapproved</b> of the earlier case and similar cases, on grounds that in enacting section 1281.98, "the Legislature sought to deter companies and employers from engaging in <i>strategic</i> nonpayment of arbitration fees; we find no indication that it intended to strip companies and employers of their contractual right to arbitration where nonpayment of fees results from a good faith mistake, inadvertence, or other excusable neglect." The supreme court remanded the case for determination whether an employer's failure to pay arbitration fees was excusable. <cite> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/2025/s284498.html">Hohenshelt v.

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a strange case <i>(that your author is mulling over)</i>, seven ex-employees of Twitter (laid off in the wake of Elon Musk's acquisition of the company) petitioned to compel Twitter to pay the JAMS arbitration fees because JAMS refused to proceed without payment. In the Southern District of New York, Judge Rakoff granted the petition to compel arbitration, but the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. The appeals court strongly hinted that the petitioners should instead have either fronted the JAMS fees themselves — or asked JAMS to terminate the arbitration and then sue Twitter in court. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14058652485675531229">Frazier v.

<h5 id="nl-arb-discov"><span class="section-number-5">23.1.33.5.</span> How much discovery is available in arbitration?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-arb-discov">
<p>
In U.S. <i>litigation</i>, parties' counsel get to take extensive "discovery" as a matter of right; typically, this takes the form of compulsory production of documents and compulsory depositions, i.e., witness interviews under oath.
</p>

<p>
But in arbitration, the applicable arbitration rules generally allow for very little such discovery, at least not without the arbitrator's approval.
</p>

<p>
One exception: California's arbitration law allows depositions and other discovery, including from third parties. <cite> See the <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/bill/SB940/2023">2024 amendment</a> to <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&division=&title=9.&part=3.&chapter=3.&article=">Cal. Code Civ. P. § 1283</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/29/governor-newsom-issues-legislative-update-9-29-24/">signed by Gov. Newsom</a>; see generally, e.g., Barbara A. Reeves, <a href="https://www.advocatemagazine.com/article/2023-july/arbitration-discovery-rights-in-california-what-you-need-to-know">Arbitration discovery rights in California: What you need to know</a> (AdvocateMagazine.com 2023). </cite>
</p>

<p>
(In a <i>non-California</i> case, of course, the parties' agreement to <i>California</i> arbitration law might not be effective to allow compulsory discovery from non-party witnesses.) 
</p>

<p>
Another: Texas's arbitration law likewise allows broad discovery rights. <cite> See <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CP/htm/CP.171.htm">Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code</a> §§ 171.050 and 171.051. </cite>
</p>

<p>
(As a practical matter, parties' counsel very often agree to exchange discovery; this can run up the bills for arbitration to where the expense is comparable to litigation, as discussed at <a href="#arb-pros-cons">23.1.33.3</a>.)

<h5 id="arb-prelim"><span class="section-number-5">23.1.33.6.</span> Who could grant preliminary injunctive relief?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-arb-prelim">
<p>
A.&nbsp; In an arbitration, each party would be free to ask a court (or other tribunal having jurisdiction) for preliminary injunctive relief; that would normally be true even if the arbitration rules allowed the arbitrator to grant preliminary relief. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; If a party <i>did</i> ask for relief from a court, etc., that in itelf shouldn't be held to waive whatever right the party has to require arbitration of other matters in the case. 
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Drafters of arbitration provisions should be very careful about stating that a party is authorized to seek <i>other forms</i> of equitable relief <i>from a court</i> when the party would otherwise have to <i>arbitrate</i> its claims for such relief. Such other (unauthorized) forms of equitable remedies could include, e.g., specific performance, rescission, and disgorgement. EXAMPLE: In a California case, a party was allowed to <i>litigate</i> its claims for those particular remedies, instead of arbitrating them, because of a similar carve-out in their arbitration agreement for "claims seeking injunctive <i>or other equitable relief</i>." 
</p>

<cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3568051458574529355">Kirk v. Ratner</a>, 74 Cal.

Otherwise, even if enhanced appeal of an arbitration award were agreed to (see Option <a href="#ArbEnhApp">23.1.26</a>), a court might nevertheless dismiss an appeal of an arbitrator's preliminary injunction, on grounds that it was not an "award" and thus that the court did not have jurisdiction to review the injunction.

<div id="outline-container-arb-conf-c" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="arb-conf-c"><span class="section-number-5">23.1.33.7.</span> Caution: Arbitrations might not be confidential</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-arb-conf-c">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Confidentiality in arbitration won't necessarily be automatic. That's true even though a primary reason parties opt to arbitrate their disputes in the first place is often to try to avoid having their business affairs made public in court proceedings. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The agreed arbitration <i>rules</i> might independently require confidentiality, possibly in the arbitrator's discretion.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>EXAMPLE: Rule R-24(a) of the <a href="https://go.adr.org/rs/294-SFS-516/images/CommercialRules_Web.pdf">Commercial Arbitration Rules</a> of the American Arbitration Association allows <i>the arbitrator</i> to impose secrecy requirements in connection with the pre-hearing exchange of confidential information and the admission of confidential evidence at the hearing.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.lcia.org/Dispute_Resolution_Services/lcia-arbitration-rules-2020.aspx#Article%2030">Article 30</a> of the LCIA Arbitration rules of the London Court of International Arbitration automatically provide for secrecy of arbitration proceedings.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <i>arbitral</i> law and/or the applicable <i>substantive</i> law might also require confidentiality, e.g., if personal health information or export-controlled information is involved. For example, apparently English arbitration law <i>implies</i> a duty of confidentiality in arbitration proceedings — and a failure to maintain confidentiality, where required, could result in the imposition of severe sanctions or the institution of legal proceedings against the discloser by other parties to the arbitration. <cite> See generally Chantal du Toit, <a href="http://arbitrationblog.practicallaw.com/reform-of-the-english-arbitration-act-1996-a-nudge-towards-reversing-the-presumption-of-confidentiality/">Reform of the English Arbitration Act 1996: a nudge towards reversing the presumption of confidentiality</a> (PracticalLaw.com 2017). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> A court being asked to enforce an arbitration agreement might not honor even an <i>agreed</i> confidentiality requirement — that's because of the strong presumption of public access to court proceedings <i>and</i> documents filed or used in court. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5024133744129204150">XPO Intermodal, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Too-strict a confidentiality requirement in an arbitration agreement might cause enforceability problems for the arbitration agreement itself — especially in employment-related cases. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17161110003396205858">Davis v.

<p>
Sometimes a contract will include an agreement to arbitrate, but then when a dispute arises, one party will refuse to participate or will try to block arbitration. When that happens, the party that <i>wants</i> arbitration will usually go to court and seek an order <i>compelling</i> arbitration.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-arb-no-class-careful">
<p>
Option <a href="#arb-class">23.1.23</a>'s prohibition of class arbitration could be disastrous financially if a company found itself having to pay arbitration fees for hundreds or even thousands of coordinated individual arbitration claims: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Suppose that an arbitrator determines that <i>class</i> arbitration between a company and its employees (or its customers, its "independent contractors," etc.) is not allowed.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Later, a court might find itself compelled to accept the arbitrator's determination, however that determination comes out (see <a href="#ArbEnhApp">23.1.26</a>).
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  This might mean that if the arbitrator decides <i>against</i> class arbitration, <i>the company could find itself on the hook for millions of dollars in individual arbitration fees</i>. Courts tend not to sympathize with companies that use class-arbitration waivers — making it costly for employees or customers to arbitrate individually — but that then try to get out of paying the required arbitration fees.

<p>
Some companies include opt-out provisions in their arbitration agreements, especially in employment agremeents and customer agreements.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Opting out of arbitration would preserve an employee's or customer's right to bring class-action litigation.</li>

At this writing, we don't really know which if any of the above "hybrid" approaches will be accepted by courts. As noted in a 2025 law-firm Web publication:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
At least one court has tentatively blessed a variant of this approach, but in so doing, noted that if the process leads to undue delay in resolution of claims, it may ultimately be deemed unconscionable.

<p>
Whether these provisions will stand up in the end is undetermined, but regardless, they represent an imperfect solution, and may do little to avoid the enormous costs of ultimately resolving large numbers of individual arbitrations.

<p>
&#x2013;  <i>Lamps Plus</i>: "[T]he FAA similarly bars an order requiring class arbitration when an agreement is not silent, but rather 'ambiguous' about the availability of such arbitration. &#x2026; Courts may not infer from an ambiguous agreement that parties have consented to arbitrate on a classwide basis.

<p>
Under the Act, arbitration awards are largely unappealable in <i>federal</i> court except on <i>very</i> limited grounds — including that "the arbitrators exceeded their powers." <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9/10">9 U.S.C. § 10</a>(a)(4).

<p>
In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1171931473148464325">Hall Street</a> (U.S. 2008), the Supreme Court held that — when the sole authority for an arbitration proceeding is the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9/10">Federal Arbitration Act</a> — courts may not entertain a challenge to the award except on the limited, misconduct-based grounds provided in section 10 of the Act. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1171931473148464325">Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v.

<p>
Later, in  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12985390297990950310">Oxford Health Plans</a> (U.S. 2013), the Court explained: 
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
<b>Because the parties bargained for the arbitrator's construction of their agreement</b>, an arbitral decision even arguably construing or applying the contract must stand, <b>regardless</b> of a court's view of its (de)merits.
</p>

<p>
Only if the arbitrator acts outside the scope of his contractually delegated authority — issuing an award that simply reflects his own notions of economic justice rather than drawing its essence from the contract — may a court overturn his determination. So <b>the sole question for us</b> is whether the arbitrator (even arguably) interpreted the parties' contract, <span class="underline">not</span> whether he got its meaning right or wrong. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12985390297990950310">Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter</a>, 569 U.S. 564, 133 S. Ct. 2064 (2013) (affirming denial of motion to vacate arbitrator's approval of class action; reformatted). For other cases, see the footnote.<sup><a id="fnr.40" class="footref" href="#fn.40" role="doc-backlink">40</a></sup> </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
The Court went on: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Nothing we say in this opinion should be taken to reflect any agreement with the arbitrator's contract interpretation, or any quarrel with Oxford's contrary reading. All we say is that <b>convincing a court of an arbitrator's error—even his grave error—is not enough.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>So long as</b> the arbitrator was "arguably construing" the contract — which this one was — <b>a court may not correct his mistakes</b> under § 10(a)(4). <b>The potential for those mistakes is the price of agreeing to arbitration</b>. 
</p>

<p>
As we have held before, we hold again: It is the arbitrator's construction of the contract which was bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator's decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his. <b>The arbitrator's construction holds, however good, bad, or ugly.</b>
</p>

<p>
In sum, Oxford chose arbitration, and it must now live with that choice. Oxford agreed with Sutter that an arbitrator should determine what their contract meant, including whether its terms approved class arbitration. The arbitrator did what the parties requested: He provided an interpretation of the contract resolving that disputed issue. His interpretation went against Oxford, maybe mistakenly so. But still, Oxford does not get to rerun the matter in a court. Under § 10(a)(4), the question for a judge is not whether the arbitrator construed the parties' contract correctly, but whether he construed it at all. Because he did, and therefore did not "exceed his powers," we cannot give Oxford the relief it wants. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. <cite> <i>Id.</i>, 133 S. Ct. at 2070-71 (cleaned up, paragraphing edited). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
More than a quarter century earlier, though, the Court held that a court <span class="underline">can</span> set aside an arbitration award that violates an explicit public policy — but the Seventh Circuit later noted that the public policy "must be well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests." <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3301538816944026652">W.R. Grace & Co. v. Rubber Workers</a>, 461 U.S. 757 (1983); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12126971135081211738">Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. v. Insall</a>, 108 F.4th 512, 517 (7th Cir. 2024) (affirming confirmation of arbitration award of post-patent-expiration royaties) (cleaned up). </cite>
</p>

<p>
And under <i>California</i> law, as summarized by a state appeals court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6337705762592340916">TGS Mgmt.</a> (Cal. App. 2020), an arbitrator will exceed her powers — and thus have her award subject to being vacated — if the award "violates a party's unwaivable statutory rights or that contravenes an explicit legislative expression of public policy." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6337705762592340916">Brown v.

</p>

<p>
<b>But:</b> Are there limits to what an arbitrator can do in "interpreting" the contract? EXAMPLE: On that issue turned the outcome in a case where "the My Pillow guy," Mike Lindell, offered a $5 million reward to anyone who could definitively prove that the 2020 presidential election hadn't been interfered with by Chinese hackers: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A three-arbitrator panel unanimously found that the reward's claimant, Zeidman, had proved his case and was entitled to the money under the published challenge rules; a federal district court confirmed the panel's award.</li>
<li>But the Eighth Circuit held that the arbitrators' interpretation of a crucial term in the contest rules had strayed into rewriting the contract — thus exceeding their powers. The court reversed the confirmation of the award and remanded to the district court. <cite> See <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca8/24-1608/24-1608-2025-07-23.pdf">Zeidman v.

</p>

<p>
<i>DCT comment:</i> Purely from a workload-management perspective, it seems quite short-sighted for courts to prohibit enhanced appeals of arbitration awards by agreement. That's because: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>parties are always free <i>not</i> to agree to arbitration — which means that their disputes likely would end up in court; and</li>

<li>surely, a busy trial judge would prefer to deal with a relatively simple case where some other "judge" — i.e., the arbitrator — had already done the work of managing the pre-trial proceedings; hearing witness testimony; reviewing exhibits and other evidence; and writing an award, so that the trial judge need only sit as a reviewing court.</li>

<p>
Tangentially: Some arbitration agreements take the opposite tack, stating that the arbitrator's decision will be final, binding, <i>and not reviewable at all by a court</i>. But U.S. courts probably won't go along with that: Courts have noted that "[s]ince federal courts are not rubber stamps, parties may not, by private agreement, relieve them of their obligation to review arbitration awards for compliance with § 10(a) <i>[of the FAA]</i>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11023880277516989724">Hoeft v.

</p>

<p>
On slightly-different facts, however, both the Fourth and Tenth Circuits held that arbitration provision <i>can</i> properly waive <i>appellate</i> review of a trial court's <i>confirmation</i> of an award. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8467321246862783689">Beckley Oncology Assoc., Inc., v.

</p>

<p>
But in another case, the Second Circuit held that "the parties’ contractual waiver of the 'right to appeal' is not clear and unequivocal and thus cannot foreclose our review of the district court’s judgment on the arbitral award."

A.&nbsp; Generally, a party doesn't have to arbitrate disputes if it didn't <i>agree</i> to arbitrate; as far back as 1960, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16446897521579226065">United Steelworkers</a> the (U.S.) Supreme Court described arbitration as "a creature of contract." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16446897521579226065">United Steelworkers of Am. v. Am. Mfg. Co.</a>, 363 U.S. 564, 570 (1960); see also <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1171931473148464325">Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v.

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Texas supreme court held that an officer of a limited-liability company (LLC) who had signed a contract on behalf of the company was not <i>personally</i> bound by the contract's forum-selection clause. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10453849277705716943">Rieder v.

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>But:</b> Under Texas law, even a party that didn't <i>sign</i> a contract containing an arbitration provision might have to arbitrate disputes arising under the contract:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Federal courts have recognized that contract law and agency principles can bind a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement under the following theories: (1) incorporation by reference, (2) assumption, (3) agency, (4) alter ego, (5) equitable estoppel, and (6) third-party beneficiary. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12980552722768661702">Wagner v.

EXAMPLE: A man's nephew bought tickets and took the man to see a "WrestleMania" show — who allegedly lost most of his hearing in one ear from pyrotechnics that were set off during the show. Affirming a WWE motion to compel the man to arbitrate his negligence claim, the Fifth Circuit said that the nephew acted as the uncle's agent for purposes of assenting to an arbitration agreement that had been presented when the nephew bought the tickets online: "An individual who permits a third party to present a ticket for admittance to an event on his behalf is bound by the terms and conditions governing the use of that ticket." To similar effect was another case brought by spectators injured at an NFL game; see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3089301678924331418">Washington Commanders</a> (4th Cir. 2024). <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6536098331807025187">World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. v.

<b>Counterexample:</b> In an "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case">edge case</a>," a worker was "staffed" to Phillips 66, which was a customer of the worker's employer.

The worker's employment agreement <i>with his employer</i> included an arbitration provision, so Phillips 66 tried to use that to compel arbitration. But the Fifth Circuit said nope: "The issue is not whether [the employee] has an arbitration agreement with anyone — it is whether he has an agreement to arbitrate <i>with the party he is suing</i>, Phillips 66."

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-arb-what">
<p>
In a typical arbitration proceeding:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One arbitrator presides at an evidentiary hearing where the disputing parties put on witnesses and offer their exhibits, as in a court trial.</li>

<li>After considering the parties' evidence, the arbitrator renders a binding decision, known as an "award."</li>

<li>If a party (typically the losing party) doesn't comply with the award voluntarily, then the other party can go to court to have the award "confirmed," which in effect turns the award into an enforceable judgment of the confirming court.</li>

<li>Usually, the court won't look especially hard at "how the sausage was made" in producing the award.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-23-1-34-2">
<p>
In standard business- and consumer arbitrations, each case is decided by a privately-engaged arbitrator, not by a publicly-employed judge. 
</p>

<p>
(Some arbitrators are retired judges, but they still act in a private capacity, not an official one.)
</p>

<p>
The only times an actual judge would be involved would be:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If a party didn't want to arbitrate, then there might be court proceedings in which a judge decided whether or not to compel arbitration.</li>
<li>if a party refused to comply with an arbitration award, then the other party would likely go to court to confirm and enforce the award.</li>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A California court held that a "review committee" procedure in an employer's "Employee Guide" did <i>not</i> constitute an agreement to arbitrate, because "a third party decision maker and some degree of impartiality must exist for a dispute resolution mechanism to constitute arbitration." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5454328679727546614">Cheng-Canindin v.

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a <i>non</i>-arbitration case, a Delaware Chancery Court judge, on his own initiative, stayed (that is, suspended) the court proceedings between a former director of a biotechnology company and the company itself. The basis for the stay was that, under the biotech company's stock-option agreement, the parties' dispute about the interpretation of the agreement was required to be submitted to a committee of the company's board of directors. (The judge later <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9617663657143793759">granted the company's motion to dismiss</a> on grounds that Terrell had waived his rights to any unexercised options.) <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5914999483225002344">Terrell v.

<p>
Arbitration used to be disfavored by U.S. courts, but Congress and (repeatedly) the Supreme Court have instructed lower courts to reverse that stance, for example:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The <i>[Federal Arbitration Act]</i> was enacted in 1925 <b>in response to widespread judicial hostility</b> to arbitration agreements. &#x2026; [The Act reflects] both <b>a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration</b> and the fundamental principle that <b>arbitration is a matter of contract</b>. In line with these principles, courts must place arbitration agreements on <b>an equal footing with other contracts</b> and enforce them according to their terms. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3870951188038012616">AT&T Mobility LLC v.

</blockquote>



<p>
Note: As discussed at <a href="#arb-prohib-cmt">23.1.34.5</a>, Congress later prohibited <i>compulsory</i> arbitration for some types of claim.
</p>

<p>
Many states' laws likewise strongly favor arbitration. EXAMPLE: The Texas supreme court noted: "Once a valid arbitration agreement is established, a strong presumption favoring arbitration arises and we resolve doubts as to the agreement’s scope in favor of arbitration." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12980552722768661702">Wagner v.

<h5 id="arb-prohib-cmt"><span class="section-number-5">23.1.34.5.</span> Some arbitration <i>requirements</i> might be legally prohibited</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-arb-prohib-cmt">
<p>
Here are some examples of disputes in the U.S. where compulsory arbitration — mandated by contract before a dispute even arises — might be prohibited by law:
</p>

<p>
1.  <i>Sexual-assault or -harassment claims:</i> In March 2022, President Biden signed the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4445/text">H.R. 4445</a> (now <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9/chapter-4">9 U.S.C. § 401</a>) which amended the Federal Arbitration Act to ban enforcement of pre-dispute agreements that would compel arbitration of claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment.
</p>

<p>
2.  <i>California employment- and consumer arbitration:</i>  In California, the statute known as <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB51">A.B. 51</a> prohibits many employers from requiring mandatory arbitration of claims under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act and certain related statutes. 
</p>

<p>
The California statute drew opposition, and a federal district court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the statute on grounds of preemption by the Federal Arbitration Act; after an initial appeal and then reconsideration, the Ninth Circuit affirmed. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=140894135503341067">Chamber of Commerce v. Bonta</a>, 62 F.4th 473 (9th Cir. 2023) <i>affirming</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8128189185209699320">Chamber of Commerce v. Becerra</a>, 438 F. Supp. 3d 1078 (E.D.Cal. 2020). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Relatedly: California's <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB940">S.B. 940</a> adds new section 1799.208 to the Civil Code; the new section prohibits sellers from requiring consumers to agree to arbitration outside of California, or under any other jurisdiction's substantive law, if the consumer's claim arises in California; consumers can void such requirements and recover their attorney fees for doing so.
</p>

<p>
And for yet another California law: As summarized in the <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/text/SB82/2025">legislative counsel's digest</a>: For "consumer use agreements," <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/text/SB82/id/3272250/California-2025-SB82-Chaptered.html">S.B. 82</a> "limit[s] the dispute resolution terms and conditions <i>[in the agreement]</i> to the use, payment, or provision of the good, service, money, or credit provided by the consumer use agreement," and "make[s] a waiver of these provisions void and unenforceable[.]" (<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/california-draws-the-line-s-b-82-5678792">Commenters are expecting</a> federal-preemption challenges.)
</p>

<p>
3.  <i>Corporate whistleblower claims:</i> Drafters working in the financial-services arena should check the Dodd-Frank Act's prohibition of mandatory arbitration of Sarbanes-Oxley Act "whistleblower" claims; see generally the Supreme Court's decision concerning the required elements of proof. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17743527888811532624">Murray v. UBS Securities, LLC</a>, 601 U.S. 23 (2024) (reversing and remanding 2d Cir.). </cite>
</p>

<p>
4.   <i>Franken Amendment and government contracts:</i> Government contractors and subcontractors should check the so-called Franken Amendment for its restrictions on arbitration clauses in employment agreements relating to certain government contracts. (The Franken Amendment apparently survived the GOP's takeover of Congress and the White House in the 2016 election, but it might be less relevant now in view of the 2022 enactment of HR 4445, discussed at subdivision 1 above.) 
</p>

<p>
5.  Moreover, in July 2014, <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/31/executive-order-fair-pay-and-safe-workplaces">President Obama signed</a> <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/08/05/2014-18561/fair-pay-and-safe-workplaces">Executive Order 13673</a> — later <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/11/06/2017-23588/guidance-for-executive-order-13673-fair-pay-and-safe-workplaces">disapproved</a> by the Republican-controlled Congress and then <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/11/06/2017-23588/guidance-for-executive-order-13673-fair-pay-and-safe-workplaces">revoked</a> by the Trump Administration — stating that in federal government contracts for more than $1 million, "contractors <i>[must]</i> agree that the decision to arbitrate claims arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or any tort related to or arising out of sexual assault or harassment may only be made with the voluntary consent of employees or independent contractors after such disputes arise"; the order includes a flowdown requirement for subcontracts for more than $1 million. 
</p>

<p>
(The Obama executive order included out exceptions for (i) the acquisition of commercial items or commercially available off-the-shelf items; (ii) collective bargaining agreements; and (iii) some but not all arbitration agreements that were in place before the employer placed its bid for the government contract in question.)
</p>

<p>
6.  <i>Car dealership franchise agreements:</i> Federal law provides that in franchise agreements between automobile manufacturers and their dealers, pre-dispute arbitration agreements are unenforceable. Interestingly, the law also states that: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever arbitration is elected to settle a dispute under a motor vehicle franchise contract, the arbitrator shall provide the parties to such contract with a written explanation of the factual and legal basis for the award." <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title15/html/USCODE-2011-title15-chap27-sec1226.htm">15 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(2)</a>.
</p>

<p>
7.  <i>Lending to military:</i> If your client provides credit to active-duty military personnel or their eligible dependents, be sure to check the regulations that implement the Military Lending Act: Those regs essentially negate <i>any</i> agreement to arbitrate consumer credit disputes between lenders and such borrowers. The regulations don't seem to distinguish between <i>pre</i>-dispute and <i>post</i>-dispute agreements to arbitrate — even though the statute itself appears to make just such a distinction. <cite> See <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/987">10 U.S.C. § 987(e)(3)</a>, implemented in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/32/232.9">32 C.F.R. § 232.9(d)</a>; see generally, e.g., <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca11/22-14211/22-14211-2024-09-05.html">Steines</a>, part II.B (11th Cir. 2024) (reviewing legislative history). </cite>
</p>

<p>
8.  <i>Livestock & poultry production:</i> Federal regulations governing livestock and poultry production impose restrictions on certain contracts mandating the use of arbitration. Under these regulations, such contracts must include, <i>on the signature page</i>, a specifically-worded notice, in conspicuous bold-faced type, allowing the producer or grower to decline arbitration; moreover, the Secretary of Agriculture seems to have the power to review agreements to determine "whether the arbitration process provided in a production contract provides a meaningful opportunity for the poultry grower, livestock producer, or swine production contract grower to participate fully in the arbitration process." <cite> <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title9-vol2/pdf/CFR-2012-title9-vol2-sec201-218.pdf">9 C.F.R. § 201.218</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
9.  <i>Home mortgage loan claims (overruled by Congress):</i> In the Truth in Lending regulations, Regulation Z was amended to prohibit pre-dispute arbitration clauses in mortgages secured by dwellings — but that regulation was <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/arbitration-agreements/">overturned in 2017</a> by the GOP Congress and President Trump under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10023">prohibits</a> reissuing an overturned rule in substantially the same form without specific congressional authorization. <cite> See <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2017-07-19/pdf/2017-14225.pdf">Arbitration Agreements</a>, 82 Fed.

</p>

<p>
Relatedly: The Second Circuit, citing cases, held that if a party were forced to arbitrate a <i>non-arbitrable</i> claim, it could cause irreparable harm, and <i>that</i> would bear on whether it would be appropriate to issue a preliminary injunction against arbitration. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16666835103155801044">Resource Grp. Int'l v. Chishti</a>, 91 F.4th 107, 115-16 (2d Cir. 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
And even if <i>a contract itself</i> is alleged to be void for illegality, a U.S. court will likely enforce <i>an arbitration-delegation provision</i> contained in the contract. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5606580596534348125">Zirpoli v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-ArbAgrmtDenied">
<p>
It could be that one party denies having agreed to arbitration in the first place — for example, because no agreement to arbitrate was ever properly formed. When that happens, the chances are that <i>the court</i> will insist on deciding whether the parties in fact agreed to arbitrate. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17597116813675708936">Ahlstrom v.

</p>

<p>
On that point, the Supreme Court has held that any challenge specifically to the <i>delegation agreement</i> will be heard by the court, not by the arbitrator; see the discussion at <a href="#m-arb-deleg">23.1.24</a>.

California's <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&division=2.&title=&part=13.&chapter=&article=">Private Attorneys General Act</a> (PAGA), at <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&division=2.&title=&part=13.&chapter=&article=">Cal. Labor Code §§ 2698 - 2699.6</a>, essentially deputizes employees to act on behalf of the state in pursuing civil actions against employers that violate the state's Labor Code.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> This is one of those areas where — if PAGA claims are a significant possibility — contract drafters should consult counsel about the latest developments. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2025/a170191.html">LaCour v. Marshalls of Calif., LLC</a>, No. A170191, slip op. (Cal. App. Dec. 23, 2025) (affirming denial of employer's motion to compel arbitration). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Some gig-economy workers have sued their companies under PAGA. In response, some companies like Uber have sought to compel arbitration under their contracts with the workers. But California courts have held that for purposes of determining standing to bring a PAGA claim, the threshold question whether such a worker is an "employee" or an "independent contractor" is for <i>the court</i> to determine and cannot be delegated to an arbitrator. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3942704712558196702">Winns v. Postmates, Inc.</a>, 66 Cal. App. 5th 803 (Cal.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A California court held that, under the Supreme Court's <i>Viking River Cruises</i> decision, "arbitration agreements between employers and employees that require arbitration of the <i>individual</i> portion of a PAGA claim <i>are</i> enforceable, but arbitration agreements that require arbitration (or waiver) of the <i>representative</i> portion <i>[i.e., the private-attorney-general portion]</i> of a PAGA claim are <i>not</i> enforceable." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14245869295467854875">Piplack v.

<p>
A.&nbsp; This "Texas Rule" is modeled on <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CP/htm/CP.38.htm">section 38.001</a> of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code — which doesn't allow a party to recover attorney fees for successfully <i>defending against</i> a claim for breach of the Con&shy;tract. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9677647125282266992">Polansky v. Berenji</a>, 393 S.W.3d 362, 368 (Tex. App.—Austin 2012) (reversing and rendering award of attorney fees to defendant that prevailed against breach-of-contract claim; citations omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; A similar rule is used in some contracts, allowing <span class="underline">not</span> a <i>prevailing</i> party per se, but a "non-breaching party" that successfully sues <i>for breach</i>, to recover fees. EXAMPLE: In an Illinois case, a contract's attorney-fee provision read: "Either party shall be entitled to recover from the other party any and all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, in successfully enforcing the terms and provisions of this Agreement." <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9372745509681249088">Price v Carri Scharf Trucking, Inc.</a>, No. 24-2481, slip op. at 4, 14-15 (7th Cir. Jun. 13, 2025) (affirming district court's refusal to award attorney fees to prevailing defendant); see also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2461051742924040526">Southern Coal Corp. v. Drummond Coal Sales, Inc.</a>, 25 F.4th 864, 876 (11th Cir. 2022) (Carnes, J., concurring in the judgment reversing and remanding district court's rejection of claim for attorney fees). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> When drafting a provision like this, it's wise to refer to the breach-of-contract plaintiff, <b>not</b> as the <i>non-breaching</i> party, but instead as, say, the "contract claimant." Doing so would address the situation that occurred in <i>Powertech</i> (N.D. Cal. 2014), where the contract in suit included a termination-for-breach provision that referred to the right <i>of the non-breaching party</i> to terminate. That wording, said the court, meant that the party that had purported to terminate the contract didn't actually have the power to do so — because <i>that</i> party was itself in breach, of a different contract provision. On that reasoning, a breach-of-contract plaintiff could lose its claim for attorney fees because the plaintiff was itself in breach of some contract provision. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13446235597793349920">Powertech Tech., Inc. v. Tessera, Inc.</a>, No. C 11-6121 CW, slip op. at part I.A (N.D. Cal. Jan. 15, 2014) (on summary judgment). </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; In California and Oregon, the law might well automatically transform such a one-sided attorney-fee clause into a prevailing-party clause, as discussed at <a href="#nl-AttyFeesCaliforniaTwoWay">23.2.6.7</a>. 
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; <b>Pro tip:</b> If your client might be more likely to be the <i>defendant</i> in a dispute, <i>and if Texas law will apply</i>, then your client might want to override the Texas Rule using a prevailing-party clause (see <a href="#r-atty-fees">23.2</a>). <b>On the other hand</b>, if your client <i>wants</i> the Texas Rule to apply, it might want to include this Option in the contract.

<h6 id="orge975bb5">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orge975bb5">
<p>
A.&nbsp; This has in mind that one of the major expenses in any lawsuit or arbitration is attorney fees for interim proceedings such as motion practice — e.g., motions filed with the court or arbitrator to compel discovery; for preliminary injunctions; for summary judgment, etc.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Much of the expense of motion practice comes from a seeming article of faith among litigation counsel, along the lines of the saying attributed to Walter Gretzky, father of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky: <i>You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take</i>. For litigation counsel, Gretzky <i>père</i>'s dictum could be paraphrased as: <i>You’ll be denied on 100% of the motions (and oppositions) that you don’t file</i>. The problem, of course, is that in situations like this, when a party's litigation counsel "takes the shot," it inflicts burden, expense, and delay on the other party and the court — too often, to no real purpose.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Oh, sure: Courts' rules of procedure typically "require" lawyers and parties to play nice. A judge <i>could</i> impose sanctions for bad behavior. 
</p>

<p>
But in reality, judges seldom impose sanctions on parties <i>or</i> on lawyers, even for behavior that might seem egregious.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp;  And a <i>lawyer's</i> concern about being sanctioned will sometimes be outweighed by concern that an angry client will think ill of the lawyer for supposedly not doing enough to "smite" the other party. Yes, smiting is "a thing": Sometimes a party to a lawsuit will want to inflict pain on its adversary even more than it wants to put the lawsuit behind it — even if, on balance, doing so would be more costly than a quick settlement. This can happen in divorce- and child-custody cases, but it's been known to happen in business litigation, too. 
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; (Psychological research has suggested that humans and other species are willing to punish <i>perceived</i> bad behavior by others, even when doing so results in personal cost. Researchers have conjectured that, over millennia, such behavior has been "programmed" by natural selection due to the evolutionary advantages of the group cohesion that can be fostered by such "costly punishment.") <cite> See, e.g., Robert Boyd, Herbert Gintis, Samuel Bowles, and Peter J. Richerson, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0630443100">The evolution of altruistic punishment</a>, Proceedings of the Nat'l Academy of Sciences (2003); Kimmo Eriksson et al., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21602-9">Perceptions of the appropriate response to norm violation in 57 societies</a> (Nature.com 2021). </cite>
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; So, by contractually providing for awards of attorney fees <i>in motion practice</i>, drafters can help encourage the parties and their lawyers to be reasonable in the positions they take along the way.

<p>
A.&nbsp; This is designed to incentivize compliance with any provision of the Con&shy;tract requiring the parties to participate in one or more dispute-resolution proceedings. That could be important in bitter lawsuits where one party wants to "smite" the other (see the discussion at <a href="#r-atty-fees-motion">23.2.5.3</a>).
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Background: At almost any point in an arbitration (or other alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") proceeding), a party that desired to delay the proceedings might go to court to challenge the propriety of the ADR proceeding. To combat such tactics, it can be useful to give a delaying party some "skin in the game"; awarding fees against a party that does so is suggested in <a href="https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/almID/1202596761854/">a 2013 article</a> by experienced arbitrator Gary McGowan (now behind a paywall).
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; This Option is informed by some real-world contract provisions that played roles in lawsuits between the parties; the intent is to provide an economic disincentive to help discourage a party from "blowing off" contractual dispute-resolution provisions. Courts have upheld contract provisions along these lines:
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A contract for the sale of real estate included a provision that "if a party does not agree first to go to mediation, then that party will be liable for the other party's legal fees in any subsequent litigation in which the party who refused to go to mediation loses &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13560064685362658088">Wuestenberg v. Rancourt</a>, 2020 ME 25, 226 A.3d 227, 232 ¶ 18 (2020) (cleaned up). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A state appeals court reversed a trial court's award of attorney fees to a prevailing defendant, on grounds that the parties' contract required mediation but the defendant had refused to participate the mediation. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6162135864162536352">Cullen v. Corwin</a>, 206 Cal. App. 4th 1074, 142 Cal. Rptr. 3d 419 (2012); see also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12137770141656613314">Lange v. Schilling</a>, 163 Cal. App. 4th 1412 (2008) (reversing award of attorney fees to prevailing plaintiff); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9518279364450992521">Rivas v. CBK Lodge General Partner, LLC</a>, No. 3:19-CV-01948 (M.D. Pa. Jul. 27, 2021) (granting motion to dismiss a defendant's third-party complaint for indemnification under a contract, on grounds that the defendant had not complied with a mediation requirement in the contract). </cite>
</p>

<p>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: A prevailing party had <i>initially</i> refused to mediate as required by the contract in suit. But later — and crucially, before the lawsuit was filed — that party had relented and offered to mediate the dispute. A state appeals court reversed a trial court's refusal to award attorney fees. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2025/h051869.html">Evleshin v. Meyer</a>, No. H051869, slip op. (Cal. App. Nov. 6, 2025). </cite>
</p>

<p>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: The Seventh Circuit held that: "Because the contract between Technical Security and EPI does not specify <i>who</i> must seek mediation and <i>when</i>, we cannot resolve this dispute on the record before us. We therefore vacate the district court’s entry of summary judgment for EPI and remand for further proceedings." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12203637376802697768">Tech. Security Integration, Inc. v EPI Techs, Inc.</a>, 126 F.4th 557, 559 (7th Cir. 2025) (vacating and remanding summary judgment; emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Tangentially: A winning party was <i>denied</i> attorney fees under an analogous clause, on grounds that the winning party never <i>asked</i> for mediation (as required by the contract) and thus the losing party had not <i>refused</i> to mediate. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13364418982812021472">Thompson v. Cloud</a>, 764 F.3d 82, 92 (1st Cir. 2014) (affirming lower-court decision). </cite>

In some jurisdictions, there might be a "special circumstances exception" to the American Rule that would allow recovery of attorney fees even without a contract provision to that effect.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-atty-fees-indem">
<p>
One possible <i>contractual</i> exception to the American Rule — even without a prevailing-party provision such as  Option <a href="#r-atty-fees-am-rule">23.2.5.1</a> — is if a contract includes <a href="#r-indem-defn">indemnity</a> language (see Protocol <a href="#r-indem-defn">16.3</a>) requiring indemnity against harm resulting from breach of the contract. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>ams-OSRAM</i> (Fed. Cir. 2025), a <a href="#r-conf-info-proto">confidentiality agreement</a> (a.k.a. "NDA") called for the parties to "hold harmless the other against any and all damage, losses or liability (including reasonable attorneys' fees) suffered by the other as a result of any breach of the representations, warranties, and agreements set forth herein." The plaintiff successfully sued the defendants for, among other things, breach of the NDA's confidentiality obligations. A federal appeals court affirmed a trial-court holding that this indemnity language — as a so-called first-party clause — overrode the American Rule and entitled the successful plaintiff to recover its attorney fees for pursuing its breach-of-contract claims. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3358739901067764223">ams-OSRAM USA Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-AttyFeeBig">
<p>
An attorney-fee award can dwarf the rest of a judgment; when a contract contains a prevailing-party attorney fees clause, the losing party could find itself on the hook for attorney fees that far exceed the amount originally in controversy.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In the hotly-contested <i>GT Issa Construction</i> (Tenn. 2021), a home builder was found to have breached a contract with a homeowner; the builder was ordered to pay damages of $6,800 — <b>plus</b> <i>more than $200,000 in attorney fees</i> under the contract's prevailing-party attorney fee clause. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15570543200639835151">GT Issa Constr., LLC v. Blalock</a>, No. E2020-00853-COA-R3-CV, slip op. (Tenn. App. Nov. 23, 2021) (affirming judgment on jury verdict). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> Some parties — for example, a large, wealthy, litigious company that's contracting with a much-smaller one — might be adamant that each party will always pay its own attorney fees; that's because the large, wealthy company wants to be able to use the cost of litigation as a way of subtly pressuring the smaller one to settle on favorable terms. To that end, parties that wanted to contractually impose the American Rule could use language such as in Option.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-atty-fees-contra">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Protocol <a href="#r-no-contra-rule">4.2</a> has in mind that Trying to back out of a contract's agreed "policy statement" (to use Ken Adams's term) should be a no-no because it often results in needless expense and delay in resolving disputes for the parties. Unfortunately, though, the law doesn't really discourage over-the-top arguments about contract language — in fact, in recent years the Texas supreme court has taken what appear to be inconsistent positions on this issue, <cite> Compare <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8074215351891178149#p416">James Constr. Grp., LLC v. Westlake Chem. Corp.</a>, 650 S.W.3d 392, 415-18 (Tex. 2022) (reversing court of appeals; contract's exclusion of consequential damages was <i>not</i> a covenant not to seek such damages) <i>with</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11246380411621584848">Transcor Astra Group S.A. v. Petrobras America Inc.</a>, 650 S.W.3d 462, 483 (Tex. 2022) (reversing court of appeals; reliance disclaimer in settlement agreement barred fraud claims and so attorney-fee award was not an abuse of discretion): "By asserting claims it had agreed never to assert, <i>Petrobras broke the promise it made in the settlement agreement and caused Astra to incur substantial fees and costs</i> to enforce that promise" (emphasis added).] although in <i>Jones</i> (5th Cir. 2025), the court held that attempting to rescind a contract to avoid payment was itself a breach. <cite> See <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/24-50096/24-50096-2025-10-07.html">Jones v.

</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; The "withdraws the contrary assertion' language in Protocol <a href="#r-no-contra-rule">4.2</a> is based (very) loosely on the procedures set forth at <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_11">Rule 11</a>(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, with which U.S. federal-court litigators are familiar.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Here are a few hypothetical examples of possible such contrary assertions:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>A</i> seeks to recover consequential damages from <i>B</i> (see <a href="#r-conseq-dam-excl">23.5</a>) when the Con&shy;tract excludes such recovery;</li>

<li><i>A</i> seeks monetary relief from <i>B</i> in excess of an agreed "cap" (see Protocol <a href="#r-dam-cap-gen">23.7</a>)</li>

<li><i>A</i> asserts a purported right, or a purported obligation on <i>B</i>'s part, that <i>A</i> had waived (see Protocol <a href="#r-waiv-defn">3.11</a>)</li>

<li><i>A</i> asserts that a notice took effect at a time inconsistent with the notice provisions stated in the Con&shy;tract (see Protocol <a href="#r-notices-rule">2.8</a>)</li>

<li><i>A</i> asserts that the Con&shy;tract or a related document was amended or otherwise modified in a manner inconsistent with the amendment provisions of the Con&shy;tract (see Protocol <a href="#r-amend-defn">2.2</a>)</li>

<li><i>A</i> asserts that an action taken by <i>A</i> was timely even though <i>A</i> took the action after a deadline stated in the Con&shy;tract or a related document (for example, a statement of work).</li>

<p>
By statute, Congress and various state legislatures have allowed or even required awards of attorney fees to specified classes of prevailing parties, thus overriding the "American Rule" that normally controls (see <a href="#r-atty-fees-am-rule">23.2.5.1</a>).
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: U.S. antitrust law requires "a reasonable attorney's fee" to be awarded to "any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws &#x2026;." <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/15">15 U.S.C. § 15(a)</a>. This statute was applied in <i>O'Bannon</i> (9th Cir. 2018), where the court affirmed an award of more than $40 million in attorney fees to a group of current and former student athletes — the athletes had sued the NCAA over a then-existing rule that prohibited student athletes from being paid for use of their names and likenesses in advertising and video games. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9455202660695657428">O'Bannon v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-AttyFeesOneSidedCmt">
<p>
Some contracts contain unilateral attorneys' fee clauses; for example, a real-estate lease might state that the <i>landlord</i> can recover its attorney fees if it has to sue the tenant, while remaining silent as to whether the <i>tenant</i> can ever recover its attorney fees. Such unilateral clauses might well be given effect by courts. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15374682586031801720">Allied Indus. Scrap, Inc., v.

Bank One Corp.</a>, 906 N.E.2d 396 (Ohio 2009). In the <i>Wilborn</i> case cited by the Sixth Circuit, the state's supreme court had affirmed dismissal of a lawsuit by borrowers against lenders; the court rejected the borrowers' claim that a unilateral attorneys' fee clause, in a residential mortgage loan agreement form, should be held void as contrary to public policy. </cite>
</p>

<p>
(In a lease, the American Rule (<a href="#r-atty-fees-am-rule">23.2.5.1</a>), combined with such a fee-shifting provision, would normally mean that the <i>tenant</i> could not recover, even if it were the prevailing party in a suit brought by the landlord — unless a statute provided otherwise, as in the California Rule discussed at <a href="#nl-AttyFeesCaliforniaTwoWay">23.2.6.7</a>.)

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-atty-fees-apos">
<p>
This book uses the simpler term <i>attorney fees</i>, about which lexicographer Bryan Garner <a href="https://lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-115-is-it-attorneys-fees-or-attorneys-fees/">observes</a>: "Although inelegant, <i>attorney fees</i> is becoming more common — presumably to avoid making a decision on <i>[where to put]</i> the apostrophe altogether." <cite> <a href="https://lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-115-is-it-attorneys-fees-or-attorneys-fees/">LawProse Lesson #115: Is it attorney’s fees or attorneys’ fees?</a>, <i>citing</i> Garner’s Dictionary of Legal Usage 94 (3d ed. 2009); compare &bull; <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1988">42 U.S.C. § 1988</a> (civil rights statute), which uses "a reasonable attorney's fee"; with &bull; <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1927">28 U.S.C. § 1927</a>, which provides for awards of excess "attorneys' fees" against attorneys who "multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously &#x2026;."</cite>
</p>

<p>
It's possible that Garner's spelling choice could be catching on: As one data point, the (U.S.) Defend Trade Secrets Act, enacted in 2016, uses "attorney fees" in a provision that requires employers to advise their employees (and individual contractors and consultants) of the individuals' whistleblower rights, as discussed at <a href="#c-ConfInfoLegalRestr">11.3.35.3</a>. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1833">18 U.S.C. § 1833</a>(b)(3)(A), (b)(4). </cite>

<p>
A.&nbsp; Note the difference between the tribunal being <i>requested</i> vs. <i>directed</i>: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
On one hand, parties to a contract can generally <i>direct</i> an arbitrator or arbitration panel to do blue-penciling. That's because <a href="#r-arb-sop">arbitration</a> is "a creature of contract"; an arbitrator's power stems solely from the parties' agreement and any agreed rules.
</p>

<p>
(As a practical matter, though: If an arbitrator were to disregard even an explicit blue-pencil request, a court might be unwilling to do anything about it; see the notes to § <a href="#nl-ArbAppFed">23.1.33.15</a>.)
</p></li>

<li>In contrast, parties to a contract <i>can't</i> "direct" a court to do anything, as discussed at <a href="#humility">30.18</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Whether a <i>court</i> will honor a blue-pencil request might well vary with the jurisdiction.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: New York's highest court allowed the state's courts to engage in blue-penciling of restrictive covenants in noncompetition covenants, <b>but only if:</b>
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the employer <i>demonstrates</i> an absence of overreaching, coercive use of dominant bargaining power, or other anti-competitive misconduct,</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-bond-waiv-bkgd">
<p>
In American law, when a party (the "movant") seeks a <i>preliminary</i> injunction or temporary restraining order, the movant typically must post security — usually in the form of a bond, commonly issued by an insurance carrier. The reason is to be sure that a pot of money is available to compensate the restrained party in case the preliminary injunction turns out to have been wrongly granted. <cite> See generally, e.g., <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_65">Fed.

<h5 id="bond-waiv-ctxt"><span class="section-number-5">23.4.2.2.</span> A hypothetical example</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-bond-waiv-ctxt">
<p>
Big companies sometimes want smaller ones to waive any requirement for a bond in connection with a motion for preliminary- or permanent injunction &#x2014; <i>but that can be a bad idea for the waiving party</i>, as discussed in the comments below. 
</p>

<p>
Consider the situation where, hypothetically, you're a small vendor trying to make a sale to a giant conglomerate:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As usual, the giant conglomerate insists on using its own purchase-order form (concerning which, see <a href="#nl-battle-forms">6.7</a>).</li>

<li>And that PO form allows the giant conglomerate to seek a preliminary injunction against you in various circumstances &#x2014; as well as proclaiming that you, the vendor, waive the bond requirement.</li>
</ul>

<p>
From the congomerate's perspective, your bond waiver would save their legal department a bit of trouble in rustling up a bond, should the conglomerate ever decided to seek a preliminary injunction against you for (allegedly) breaching the the contract. 
</p>

<p>
So should you, the vendor, agree to the waiver? Ideally, no, for the reasons discussed below &#x2014; although it might be an acceptable business risk.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-bond-waiver-bad" class="outline-5 olnum">
<h5 id="bond-waiver-bad"><span class="section-number-5">23.4.2.3.</span> <b>Caution:</b> <i>Agreeing</i> to a bond waiver could be dangerous</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-bond-waiver-bad">
<p>
Any party asked to agree to a bond waiver should think hard about it. Suppose that events play out like this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The big company successfully obtains a preliminary injunction forbidding you from doing whatever is upsetting the big company.</li>

<li>This interferes greatly with your business &#x2014; possibly even putting you <i>out</i> of business.</li>

<li>Then later, it turns out (perhaps after a full trial) that the preliminary injunction shouldn't have ben granted after all.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you'd previously waived the bond requirement, then <i>you'd have no recourse</i> for the wrongful injunction.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Supreme Court once noted: "A party injured by the issuance of an injunction later determined to be erroneous has no action for damages in the absence of a bond" (citations omitted). <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3301538816944026652">W.R.

Rev. 903, 908-09 & nn.25-26 (2009). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Of course, a court might not give effect to a contractual bond waiver.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>EXAMPLE: In a Delaware chancery-court case, Vice Chancellor Glasscock imposed a bond requirement notwithstanding a contractual waiver, noting that "although this Court has enforced bond waivers when granting motions for preliminary injunctions, the existence of such a waiver does not bind the Court." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2785649805710575760">Steward Health Care Sys. LLC v. Tenet Bus. Servs. Corp.</a> (Del. Ch.)

<li>EXAMPLE: In a California case, an employment agreement stated that the company, but not the employee, was <i>entitled</i> to injunctive relief, and without posting a bond (on the subject of a bond waiver, see Protocol <a href="#r-bond-waiver">23.4</a>). An appeals court regarded this as a factor in the agreement's unconscionability. <cite> See <a href="https://cases.justia.com/california/court-of-appeal/2025-b337435.pdf?ts=1749843049">Silva v. Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.</a>, No. B337435, slip op. at 22-23 (Cal. App. Jun. 13, 2025) (affirming trial court’s order finding employer’s arbitration agreement unenforceable and denying employer’s motion to compel arbitration) (citing cases). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
But as the saying goes, hope is not a plan &#x2014; a prospective respondent might be taking a considerable business risk by gambling that a court would disregard a bond waiver.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-r-conseq-dam-excl">

It can be worthwhile to define "consequential" damages, because the term's vagueness, and its different meanings in different jurisdictions, can lead to costly and perhaps-avoidable litigation.

<p>
When this Protocol is agreed to: In all matters relating to the Con&shy;tract, the term "<b>consequential damages</b>" refers to a monetary award to compensate a party for harm resulting from a breach of the Con&shy;tract, where <b>at the time the Con&shy;tract was entered into</b> (or, if the Con&shy;tract is a master agreement, the time the relevant transaction was agreed to), all of the following were true: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the harm was not <i>generally</i> foreseeable — that is, reasonable people, experienced in the relevant area of business, would not have expected the harm, in the ordinary course of things, to be a probable result of the breach — and so the breaching party normally would <b>not</b> have been liable for that harm; <b>and</b></li>

<li>the breaching party nevertheless knew or had reason to know of <b>special circumstances</b> that made the harm reasonably likely to result from breach, and so the breaching party <b>would</b> be liable for the harm.</li>

A.&nbsp; This Protocol follows the general approach of the classic English case, <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i>, discussed in more detail at <a href="#conseq-dam-defn-cmt">23.5.8.7</a>.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2 could be thought of as "Well, <i>you</i> should have foreseen it!" harm — as in, experienced people would be at least mildly surprised that the harm in question would have occurred from the breach.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; The term <b>atypical damages</b> seems a more-apt label than <i>consequential damages</i>, because the latter is kind of a dumb name (see <a href="#conseq-dam-dumb">23.5.8.11</a>). But of course it'd likely be a fool's errand try to change generations of lawyer-speak.

For example: In <i>Sweet Additions</i> (11th Cir. 2025), the court held that an exclusion of incidental- and consequential damages, including "lost profit," did not apply to "lost profits and the costs of substitute products to the extent that those damages are direct and otherwise satisfy the provision’s total cap on recoverable damages." <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12757742857379856958">Sweet Additions Ingredient Processors, LLC v. Meelunie America, Inc.</a>, 139 F.4th 1217, 1128-29 (11th Cir. 2025) (vacating and remanding $1.4 million judgment in favor of buyer of tapioca powder against supplier; see also <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12044315946428687112">Reid Hospital & Health Care Services, Inc. v. Conifer Revenue Cycle Solutions, LLC</a>, 8 F.4th 642, 644 (7th Cir. 2021) (reversing summary judgment): A consequential-damages exclusion didn't apply — the contract in suit was for revenue collection, and the revenue lost due to breach "would have been the direct and expected result of Conifer’s failures to collect and process that revenue as required under the contract"; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13250629116132412621">Tractebel Energy Mktg., Inc. v. AEP Power Mktg., Inc.</a>, 487 F.3d 89, 109-110 (2d Cir. 2007) (reversing judgment, after bench trial, denying plaintiff its lost profits). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Tangentially: In <i>Endless River</i> (6th Cir. 2025), a trial court granted JMOL for the defendant, vacating a jury verdict of $18.3 million in favor of the plaintiff: The court ruled that the plaintiff's claim for lost profits was barred by the contract's exclusion of consequential damages, "including but not limited to loss of good will and lost profits or revenue" (capitalization normalized). (The trial court noted that "[t[he parties recognize" that the applicable law, in that case Illinois, distinguished between lost profits when claimed as <i>consequential</i> damages versus when claimed as <i>direct</i> damages.) 
</p>

<p>
On appeal, the Sixth Circuit declined even to address the lost-profits exclusion question: in an unpublished decision, the panel said it hadn't been convinced that the testimony of the plaintiff's damages expert — which had been the only damages evidence offered by the plaintiff — amounted to a measurement of <i>lost profits</i>. The court nevertheless affirmed the JMOL on the alternative ground that the plaintiff's damages testimony lacked relevance and reliability; the panel made it clear that it would have reversed the trial judge's <i>Daubert</i> ruling, which had allowed the expert testimony. <cite> See <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ohnd.242427/gov.uscourts.ohnd.242427.288.0.pdf">Endless River Techs.

<p>
In <i>Severn Peanut</i> (4th Cir. 2015), applying North Carolina law, the court explained some facts of life to customers that negotiate services contracts containing consequential-damages exclusions. This took place in a case where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While doing an $8,400 job, a fumigation company had improperly applied a dangerous pesticide to a peanut dome owned by the plaintiff — this led to "fire, an explosion, loss of approximately 20,000,000 pounds of peanuts, loss of business, and various cleanup costs"; the plaintiff's total losses amounted to some $19 million.</li>

<li>The peanut company (and its insurer) filed suit against the fumigation company, <i>but the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the fumigation company</i> because the company's contract excluded consequential damages.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The appeals court affirmed, explaining:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
<i>[Customers]</i> faced with consequential damages <b>limitations</b> in contracts have two ways to protect themselves. 
</p>

<p>
First, they may purchase <b>outside insurance</b> to cover the <i>consequential</i> <i>[sic]</i> risks of a contractual breach <i>[by the supplier]</i>, 
</p>

<p>
and second, they may attempt to <b>bargain for greater protection</b> against breach from their contractual partner. 
</p>

<p>
Severn <i>[the plaintiff]</i> apparently did take the former precaution — it has recovered over $19 million in insurance proceeds from a company whose own business involves the contractual allocation of risk. But it did not take the latter one, and there is no inequity in our declining to rewrite its contractual bargain now. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13541308803683173077">Severn Peanut Co. v.

In 1984, an Atlantic City casino entered into a contract with a construction manager respecting the casino’s renovation. The construction manager was to be paid a <b>$600,000</b> fee for its construction management services. In breach of the agreement, completion of construction was delayed by several months.

<i>Students: Read the IBM example below, then just skim the rest of this section.</i>
</p>

<p>
Discerning the difference between excluded <i>consequential damages</i> and recoverable "general" damages can sometimes be difficult; courts are often forced to parse sometimes-needlessly complex contract language and lawyer arguments to determine which is which. 
</p>

<p>
Classifying particular types of damages as consequential or "direct" — a poor choice of names, IMHO — might be a very <b>subjective</b> exercise. EXAMPLE:  Consider an Indiana appellate court's 2018 decision in the long-running <i>Indiana v. IBM</i> litigation — in a second trial (on remand) over a failed computer-system acquisition, the trial judge held that:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;   IBM had to pay for a replacement computer system that the state acquired after IBM was fired, known as the "Hybrid" system — even though the Hybrid system was <i>an upgrade</i> from the system that IBM had agreed to build; and
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The additional cost <i>of the upgrade</i>, said the trial judge, was properly classified as <i>direct</i> <i>[sic]</i> damages resulting from IBM's breach — and thus was subject to an agreed cap of $125 million — and not as <i>consequential</i> damages, which would have been subject to a much-lower cap of $3 million.
</p>

<p>
The trial judge's decision was affirmed on appeal. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15971897558315184244">IBM v. Indiana</a>, 112 N.E.3d 1088, 1100-01 (Ind. App. 2018), <i>summarily aff'd</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7430114161307512070">138 N.E.3d 255</a> (Ind. 2019). </cite>
</p>

<p>
But: Dissenting on the upgrade-as-direct-damages issue, a state supreme court judge argued unsuccessfully that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[I]t was not IBM's breach but the State's decision to switch to the different, more expensive Hybrid system that caused the State to incur these additional expenses. The State's additional, Hybrid-related costs are at most consequential damages, not direct damages. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7430114161307512070">138 N.E.3d 255</a> at 261 (Slaughter, J., dissenting in part, concurring in part) </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a <i>(debatable)</i> ruling, the New Hampshire supreme court affirmed a trial-court holding that a customer's cost of recreating lost data, necessitated by its outsourcer's alleged mistakes that caused the loss of the data, were "consequential" damages and therefore not recoverable because of an exclusion clause in the contract. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=520704120317666281">Mentis Sciences, Inc., v.

<p>
(Less debatably, the court came out the same way on the customer's claim for damages for its inability to bid on certain government contracts due to the unavailability of the lost data.)

Some experienced practictioners (including me) believe that a more-sensible approach will <i>sometimes</i> be to do the following:

<h5 id="dam-excl-list"><span class="section-number-5">23.5.8.5.</span> Reasons <i>not</i> to include a "laundry list" of exclusions</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-dam-excl-list">
<p>
Some drafters like to include a detailed "laundry list" of highly-specific categories of excluded damages, such as the examples below.
</p>

<p>
My usual practice is to provide such a laundry list only cautiously and selectively, because doing so generally entails the drafter's figuratively crossing his- or her fingers —
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>that courts will interpret the laundry list as the drafter hoped; and</li>

<li>that in drafting the list, the drafter won't inadvertently <i>omit</i> one or more categories of damages that later proves important.  (Relatedly: See also the discussion of the doctrine of <i>ejusdem generis</i> at <a href="#r-incl-defn">22.25</a>.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The following list of categories of damages to be excluded have been compiled from various agreement forms, <i>but the list should be reviewed carefully</i>, as some could be a bad idea in particular circumstances: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>incidental damages — which are defined in sections <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-710">2-710</a> (seller's incidental damages) and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-715">2-715</a> (buyer's consequential damages) of the Uniform Commercial Code;</li>
<li>punitive, exemplary, or special damages — which normally would not be available in a pure breach-of-contract case but might be available under other theories, for example in tort;</li>
<li>indirect damages;</li>
<li>breach of statutory duty;</li>
<li>business interruption;</li>
<li>loss of business or of business opportunity;</li>
<li>loss of competitive advantage;</li>
<li>loss of data;</li>
<li>loss of privacy;</li>
<li>loss of confidentiality <i>[Editorial comment: This exclusion would normally be a</i> really <i>bad idea, at least from the perspective of a party disclosing confidential information]</i>;</li>
<li>loss of goodwill;</li>
<li>loss of investment;</li>
<li>loss of product;</li>
<li>loss of production;</li>
<li>loss of profits <i>from collateral business arrangements</i>;</li>
<li>loss of cost savings;</li>
<li>loss of use;</li>
<li>loss of revenue;</li>
<li>wasted expenditure;</li>
<li>reduced value of stocks, bonds, goods, commodities, or other assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For a summary of cases addressing such "laundry lists" in U.S., English, and Australian courts, <i>see</i> a 2015 article by noted scholar-practitioner Glenn West. <cite> See Glenn D. West, <a href="http://www.weil.com/~/media/files/pdfs/consequential-damages-redux.pdf">Consequential Damages Redux: An Updated Study of the Ubiquitous and Problematic "Excluded Losses" Provision in Private Company Acquisition Agreements</a>, 70 Bus.

</p>

<p>
Concerning wasted expenditure, see the 2022 English case of <i>Soteria Insurance v IBM UK</i> — which seems to have been a sad tale of an IT project gone sideways — where the court of appeal held that an contract's exclusion of "loss of profit, revenue, [and] savings" did <span class="underline">not</span> protect IBM from being held liable for its customer's "wasted expenditure" resulting from IBM's wrongful repudiation of the contract. <cite> <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2022/440.html">Soteria Ins.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-conseq-dam-unconsc">
<p>
Courts will sometimes hold that exclusions of consequential damages are "unconscionable." Indeed, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-719">UCC § 2-719</a>(3) specifically says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable.

<p>
Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable

but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-conseq-dam-defn-cmt">
<p>
This Protocol essentially follows the rule in the landmark 1854 English case of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i> (the "corn mill crankshaft case").  <i>Hadley</i> has been much remarked on over the decades; the opinion and its progeny are still relied on in American courts and likely studied by most if not all American law students. In <i>Hadley</i>: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  A corn mill in Gloucester utilized a steam engine to clean and grind corn.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The steam engine's crankshaft broke.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The mill owners were informed that to have a new crankshaft made, they would have to ship the broken shaft to a manufacturer in Greenwich so that the new one could be made to the same dimensions, using the broken one as a pattern.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The mill owners shipped off the broken crankshaft, but the carrier was five days late in delivering the broken crankshaft to the manufacturer.
</p>

<p>
The corn mill's owners sued the carrier for, among other things:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the profits that the corn mill would have earned during the mill's extra "down time" caused by the carrier's delay in shipping the broken crankshaft; and</li>

<li>the wages that the corn mill's owners had to pay their idle employees during that extra down time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In an opinion by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Alderson_(judge)">Sir Edward Hall Alderson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_of_the_Exchequer">Baron of the Exchequer</a> (i.e., a judge of an English commercial court), the <i>Hadley</i> court reasoned as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Now we think the proper rule is such as the present is this: 
</p>

<p>
Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered <b>either</b> arising[:]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things</i>, from such breach of contract itself, <b>or</b></li>

<li>such as may reasonably be supposed to have been[:]

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in the contemplation of <i>both parties</i>,</li>

<li><i>at the time</i> they made the contract,</li>

<li>as the <i>probable result</i> of the breach of it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, if the special circumstances under which the contract was actually made were <i>communicated</i> by the plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known to both parties, [then] the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract, which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so known and communicated. 
</p>

<p>
<b>But</b>, on the other hand, <i>if these special circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract</i>, [then] he, at the most, could only be supposed to have had in his contemplation <i>the amount of injury which would arise generally</i>, and in the great multitude of cases not affected by any special circumstances, from such a breach of contract. For such loss would <b>neither</b> have flowed <i>naturally</i> from the breach of this contract <i>in the great multitude of such cases</i> occurring under <i>ordinary circumstances</i>, <b>nor</b> were the special circumstances, which, perhaps, <i>would</i> have made it a reasonable and natural consequence of such breach of contract, <i>communicated to or known by</i> the defendants. &#x2026; <cite> See <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Exch/1854/J70.html">Hadley v.

</p>

<p>
First are general damages, which, to be recoverable, must have been foreseeable to others generally:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Loss that results from a breach in the ordinary course of events is <b>foreseeable as the <i>probable result</i> of the breach</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Such loss is sometimes said to be the "natural" result of the breach, in the sense that its occurrence accords with the <i>common experience of ordinary persons</i>. &#x2026; The damages recoverable for such loss that results in the ordinary course of events are sometimes called "general" damages. <cite> Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 351, "Unforeseeability And Related Limitations On Damages," comment b (citations omitted, emphasis and extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
Next, are so-called consequential damages, namely <i>uncommon</i> or <i>out-of-the-ordinary</i> damages that nevertheless, at the time the parties entered into the contract, were foreseeable <i>by the breaching party</i> due to special circumstances and thus would be recoverable unless excluded:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
If loss results other than in the ordinary course of events, there can be no recovery for it unless it was <b>foreseeable by the party in breach</b> because of special circumstances that he had reason to know when he made the contract. &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
The damages recoverable for loss that results other than in the ordinary course of events* are sometimes called "special" or "consequential" damages. <i>These terms are often misleading</i>, however, and it is not necessary to distinguish between "general" and "special" or "consequential" damages for the purpose of the rule stated in this Section. <cite> <i>Id.</i> (ditto). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-conseq-dam-other">
<p>
Some American courts have tried different ways of defining <i>consequential damages</i>, but it's not clear that these redefinitions are helpful.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Eleventh Circuit remarked that "[t]he key distinction between direct damages and consequential damages is that the former compensate for <i>the value of the promised performance</i>, while the latter compensate for <i>additional losses incurred as a result of the breach</i>." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14493733455299808016">AcryliCon USA, LLC v. Silikal GmbH</a>, 985 F.3d 1350, 1369 (11th Cir. 2021) (summarizing Georgia law; emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a similar vein, the Fourth Circuit ventured that "[c]onsequential or special damages for breach of contract &#x2026;. are distinguished from general damages, which are based on <i>the value of the performance itself, not on the value of some consequence that performance may produce.</i>" <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13541308803683173077">Severn Peanut Co. v. Industrial Fumigant Co.</a>, 807 F.3d 88, 90-91 (4th Cir. 2015) (cleaned up, emphasis added). <i>Accord:</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=520704120317666281">Mentis Sciences, Inc., v. PIttsburgh Networks, LLC</a>, 243 A.3d 1223, 1228 (N.H. 2020). </cite>
</p>

<p>
This distinction seems unhelpful, though: Arguably, "the value of the performance itself" <span class="underline">is</span> the value of the consequences to be produced — no more and no less. As Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt famously put it: 
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole! #+end_quot <cite> Quoted in Clayton M. Christensen, Scott Cook and Taddy Hall, <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5170.html">What Customers Want from Your Products</a> (HBS.edu 2006). </cite>e
</p>

<p>
Similar thoughts had been expressed previously, e.g., "When you buy a razor, you buy a smooth chin—but you could wear a beard." <cite> Quoted in <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/03/23/drill/">No One Wants a Drill. What They Want Is the Hole</a> (QuoteInvestigator.com 2019). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the focus of the value of the performance would be more useful if it were phrased as the <i>market</i> value of the performance itself, i.e., the value that <i>others</i>, not in the plaintiff's particular circumstances, would theoretically pay for the performance.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Supreme Court of Texas espoused a variation on the <i>Hadley</i> approach, where the court held that: 
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
Direct damages are the <i>necessary and usual</i> result of the defendant's wrongful act; they flow naturally <i>and necessarily</i> from the wrong. &#x2026; Consequential damages, on the other hand, result naturally, <i>but not necessarily</i>. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15493436816047576736">El Paso Marketing, L.P. v. Wolf Hollow I, L.P.</a>, 383 S.W.3d 138, 144 (Tex. 2012) (cleaned up, formatting altered), <i>quoting</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1751498717150008353">Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp</a>., 945 S.W.2d 812, 816 (Tex. 1997). </cite>e
</p>



<p>
For cases decided under Texas law, the state supreme court's test thus replaces <i>Hadley's</i> "usual course of things" with "<i>necessary</i> and usual."
</p>

<p>
It's unclear, though, how helpful the Texas court's reformulation would be to trial counsel hoping to prove (or refute) a case, or to a jury seeking to distinguish recoverable from unrecoverable damages.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-conseq-dam-dumb">
<p>
I wish <i>(but I'm not holding my breath)</i> that the legal community could agree to rename "consequential damages" as something like "atypical damages" — both are clunky, but at least the latter one conveys the essence of the concept: While <i>unforeseeable</i> damages are <span class="underline">never</span> recoverable, it's possible for damages to be <i>foreseeable</i> in one of two different ways:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>because, in the ordinary course without any special circumstances, <i>reasonable people</i> would have foreseen the damages possibility; and/or</li>

<li>because, <i>at the time that the parties entered into the contract, the defendant had some other reason</i> to foresee such damages; as the Texas supreme court held: "When one party has given notice of the consequences of breach at the time of contracting, no further inquiry into the foreseeability of those consequences is required"; <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5704495266894759222">Signature Indus'l Servs., LLC v. Int'l Paper Co.</a>, 638 S.W.3d 179, 192 n.8 (Tex. 2022). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
And of course, if neither of the above conditions is shown to be true, then the damages simply aren't recoverable, period (at least under U.S. law). <cite> <i>See id.</i> at 184 (reversing court of appeals and rendering judgment against plaintiff because "legally insufficient evidence supported the award of consequential damages"). </cite>

<p>
In some lawsuits, the outcome can turn on "swearing matches" in which the judge and/or jury must decide which witness's testimony they believe. The law, however, has long recognized that if a witness has a stake in the outcome — known as an "interested" witness — then his- or her testimony might be unreliable. 
</p>

<p>
That's why, for certain important matters, the law <i>requires</i> that such testimony must be supported by corroborating evidence. The corroboration requirement takes into account that <i>interested</i> witnesses might "describe [their] actions in an unjustifiably self-serving manner &#x2026;. The purpose of corroboration [is] to prevent fraud, by providing independent confirmation of the [witness's] testimony." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=259346243412014497">Sandt Technology, Ltd. v. Resco Metal & Plastics Corp.</a>, 264 F.3d 1344, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (affirming relevant part of summary judgment; as a matter of law, inventor provided sufficient corroboration of date of invention) (cleaned up).  ]

<p>
Courts recognize that human beings are far from perfect in perceiving and remembering events: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We have active imaginations.</li>

<li>We sometimes "catch" only part of what we see and hear.</li>

<li>At times we misunderstand what they do see or hear.</li>

EXAMPLE: In a Ninth Circuit age-discrimination decision, an IRS employee was fired for having engaged in unauthorized access to information about people she knew. The employee <i>claimed</i> that she was fired because of her age — but the only evidence the employee produced was her own statement about things that a manager had <i>allegedly</i> said. Affirming summary judgment against the employee, the Ninth Circuit held that "<b>uncorroborated and self-serving testimony</b>" was not enough to establish a genuine issue of material fact about whether her firing had been based on pretextual reasons. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17000541296545109470">Opara v.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <b>Did the Beatles play twice at Shea Stadium?</b> Bob Smeaton, the director of "The Beatles Anthology" series, recounted an episode in which George Harrison was convinced that the Beatles had played just one 1966 concert at Shea Stadium, not two — even after being shown film footage that proved otherwise:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“George says, ‘We didn’t play Shea Stadium twice,’” Smeaton said. “I said, ‘George, you did.’ He says, ‘Look, Bob, I was in the band; you weren’t.’ I says, ‘George, I’ve got the footage.’ So we showed him, and George says, ‘You know what? I’m still convinced we didn’t play Shea Stadium again in ’66.’” <cite> Ben Sisario, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/arts/music/beatles-anthology-gen-x.html?unlocked_article_code=1.5k8.e8FG.AUOqYcTFNg2a&smid=url-share">How the Beatles Got Their Hooks Into Gen X and Never Let Go</a>, N.Y.

<p>
EXAMPLE: <b>The imagined red beret:</b> In 1972, during "The Troubles" in Northern Ireland, David Tereshchuk, then a junior TV journalist, was caught up in a protest that unexpectedly turned violent. British paratroopers suddenly fired on the mostly-Catholic crowd — killing 14 of them. The incident became known as Bloody Sunday. 
</p>

<p>
Writing decades later, Tereshchuk recounted that "<b>One recollection is stronger than any other</b> – a soldier <b>in a red beret</b>, down on one knee, leveling his self-loading rifle toward me and shooting." (Emphasis added.) But, Tereshchuk goes on, "<b>as all the photographs clearly demonstrate</b>, he was wearing a helmet." Tereshchuk concluded that "I was simply wrong." Tereshchuk ends his essay with this: "And yet, even with an indisputable set of photographs in front of me, <b>I close my eyes and still see a red beret</b>." <cite> David Tereshchuk, <a href="https://www.questioningchristian.org/2004/10/why_i_cant_acce.html">An Unreliable Witness</a>, NY Times Magazine, Jan. 28, 2001, p. 66 (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <b>My dad the (alleged) daredevil pilot:</b> My late father was an Iowa farm boy turned Air Force fighter pilot who served in the Korean War. He seldom talked about the war itself — but he did tell of how, not long after his return, he flew a routine training mission that took him near his <span class="underline">tiny</span> home town, where he planned to spend the night with his parents. Dad said he made a pass over the town, waggled his wings, and headed for the airport in a nearby city.
</p>

<p>
After landing, Dad made his way to his folks' house and walked into town. Someone told him about all the excitement that had occurred earlier in the day: An unknown pilot had repeatedly buzzed the town, flying back and forth along the main street — so low that the plane went <i>right under the telephone wires</i> — scaring everyone half to death. 
</p>

<p>
Dad had done no such thing <i>(or at least so he said &#x2026;.)</i>. But the other guy — who, if <i>I</i> remember Dad's tale correctly, had not even seen the event — was utterly convinced of it: In just half a day and one or two retellings, the story had mutated.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <b>The misremembered court opinion:</b> When I was a new lawyer, a senior partner — one of the leading intellectual-property litigators in the U.S. — sent me to the firm's library to look for a particular court opinion. The case, he said, had involved <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in a specific appeals court where years before the partner had been a judicial clerk; the court's holding, said the partner, had been such-and-such.
</p>

<p>
I searched and searched the case books. All I could find was a case involving Party A and <i>Party C</i> (<b>not</b> <i>B</i>), and the court's holding had been <i>the exact opposite</i> of what the partner had believed. 
</p>

<p>
I reported this information back to the partner, showing him the court's opinion. His response was, in essence, "that's crazy, that's not the way the law is." But there was no mistaking it: The partner had remembered the case, not the way it actually turned out, but the way he <i>thought</i> it should have turned out.
</p>

<p>
Human psychology is just that way. Lawyers have to deal with that in every lawsuit. There can be no reasonable dispute about it.

<h5 id="corrob-barbed"><span class="section-number-5">23.6.3.4.</span> The SCOTUS pedigree for requiring corroboration</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-corrob-barbed">
<p>
The U.S. Supreme Court explained the need for corroboration of self-interested statements in a famous 19th-century case concerning a patent for a type of barbed wire:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
We have now to deal with certain unpatented devices, claimed to be complete anticipations of this patent, the existence and use of which are proven only by <b>oral testimony</b>.
</p>

<p>
In view of <b>the unsatisfactory character of such testimony, arising from</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the forgetfulness of witnesses,</li>

<li>their liability to mistakes,</li>

<li>their proneness to recollect things as the party calling them would have them recollect them,</li>

<li>aside from the temptation to actual perjury,</li>
</ul>

<p>
courts have not only imposed upon defendants the burden of proving such devices, but have required that the proof shall be clear, satisfactory and beyond a reasonable doubt.
</p>

<p>
<i>[Comment: Patent law in the U.S. now requires only "clear and convincing evidence" on this point, not proof "beyond a reasonable doubt."]</i> Witnesses whose memories are prodded by <i>the eagerness of interested parties</i> to elicit testimony favorable to themselves are not usually to be depended upon for accurate information. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8473856844870993790">Washburn & Moen Mfg.

<p>

</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; An English court of appeal called this before-the-setoff rule the "commercial common sense" approach. <cite> See <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2024/1330.html">Topalsson GmbH v. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd.</a>, [2024] EWCA Civ 1330 at ¶¶ 22-20 (reversing trial-court judgment on that point). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <i>Example:</i> To illustrate the operation of this set-off section, consider the following hypothetical example:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Con&shy;tract is hypothetically between "Alice" and "Bob" and states that Bob's liability to Alice is capped at $100.</li>

<li>In a first lawsuit relating to the Con&shy;tract, Alice wins a judgment against Bob for $70 in damages and $10 in attorney fees and costs.</li>

<li>Bob's other party's appeals are unsuccessful, so Bob eventually pays Alice the $80 total liability amount.</li>

<li>Later, in a different lawsuit relating to the Con&shy;tract, Bob is found liable to Alice for $350; again, Bob's appeals are unsuccessful.</li>

<li>So: Because of the agreed damages cap, Bob's liability to Alice in the second lawsuit is not $350, but $20 — that is, the difference between the $80 that Bob previously paid to Alice (as a result of the first lawsuit) and the $100 damages cap.</li>

<p>
As a review of aspects of the first-year Contracts course in law school, here's a brief summary from a federal appeals court decision:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The goal of measuring damages for a breach-of-contract claim is to provide just <b>compensation</b> for any loss or damage <b>actually sustained as a result</b> of the breach. 
</p>

<p>
[1]  The <b>normal</b> measure in such cases is the <b>benefit of the bargain</b>, which seeks to place the injured party in the economic position it would have been in had the contract been performed, i.e., <b>expectancy damages</b>.
</p>

<p>
[2]  <b>Alternatively</b>, a plaintiff may seek <b>reliance</b> damages, which are measured by the amount necessary to compensate that party for a loss already suffered. 
</p>

<p>
Put another way, <b>reliance</b> damages seek to <b>put the injured party in the position he would have been in</b> had he not relied on the promise. 
</p>

<p>
[2A]  <b>Out-of-pocket reliance damages</b> measure the difference between the value the buyer has <i>paid</i> and the value of what he has <i>received</i>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18008475757367889550">National Oilwell Varco, L.P., v. Auto-Dril, Inc.</a>, 68 F.4th 206, 216-17 (5th Cir. 2023) (reversing and remanding summary judgment in relevant part; cleaned up, formatting edited) (King, J.). </cite> To similar effect is a U.S. statute dating back to 1936 concerning maritime liability, which prohibits "[t]he owner, master, manager, or agent of a vessel transporting passengers between ports in the United States, or between a port in the United States and a port in a foreign country <i>[from contractually limiting liability]</i> for personal injury or death caused by the negligence or fault of the owner or the owner’s employees or agents."

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-damages-cap-notes">
<p>
Here are a few hypothetical examples of damages-cap provisions, written in terse language: 
</p>

<p>
(a)  <i>ABC's liability for breach is capped at 2X</i>: This means that ABC would not be liable for — and no other party may seek — more than two times the amount <b>paid</b> or <b>payable</b> to ABC.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> A damages cap could limits recovery to amounts <b>paid</b> — which could be minimal or even nothing. That happened in an Eighth Circuit case: A customer paid a software provider an initial fee and was supposed to pay more in the future. After the customer unilaterally terminated the contract (because reasons), the provider sued for the unpaid <b>future</b> payments — but the court granted summary judgment for the customer because the contract limited the rejected each party's liability to the fees <b>paid</b>, not those amount <b>payable</b>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9555396582839070604">Baldwin Hackett & Meeks, Inc. v. Early Warning Services, LLC</a>, 153 F.4th 656 (8th Cir. 2025) (affirming summary judgment in favor of customer). </cite>
</p>

<p>
(b)  <i>ABC's liability for breach is capped at 3X on a 12-month lookback</i>: This means that ABC would not be liable for, and no other party may seek, more than three times the amount that ABC was paid (or was owed), in the 12-month period just before the earliest event giving rise to the liability, regardless whether the other party knew or should have known that the event had occurred.

</p>

<p>
(c)  <i>Damages cap: 2X the total contract value</i>: This means that neither party would be liable, and no other party may seek, more than two times the total amount to be paid under the contract, for example, in fees for services or payment for goods.

<h5 id="lim-liab-carve-out"><span class="section-number-5">23.7.8.3.</span> Carve-outs for fraud, willful misconduct, etc.?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-lim-liab-carve-out">
<p>
Damages-cap provisions sometimes include carve-outs for <a href="#gross-negl">gross negligence</a>; <a href="#willful-defn">willful misconduct</a>; <a href="#reckless-defn">recklessness</a>; and fraud — that way, if the plaintiff can show that the defendant engaged in carved-out (mis)conduct, then the cap's upper limit on a damage award would not apply, and the plaintiff could recover damages in excess of the cap.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <i>Fraud carve-out:</i> In the aftermath of a software-development project <a href="https://grammarist.com/idiom/go-pear-shaped">gone pear-shaped</a>, a supplier, EDS (a UK-based unit of HP) found itself settling a contract dispute with British Sky Broadcasting for some USD $460 million — more than four times the value of the original contract — because an English judge found that an EDS executive had lied to Sky about EDS's capabilities, and thus the contract's limitation of EDS's liability to £30 million was lifted because of an express carve-out for fraud in the limitation. <cite> See the extended discussion of this and similar cases at <a href="#RelDisclBkgd">22.34.6.7</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <i>Recklessness carve-out:</i> In Ohio's <i>Bakhshi</i> bar-owner case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A contractor agreed to gut and remodel a building for use as a neighborhood bar.</li>

<li>The contractor failed to do so by the agreed completion date.</li>

<li>This caused the customer, a would-be bar owner, to miss the November-December holiday season.</li>

<li>The court agreed with the bar owner that the contractor’s conduct had been “reckless” — causing the breach to fall within a stated carve-out from the contract’s exclusion of consequential damages.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court affirmed an award of the bar owner’s lost profits. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16232962081601711418">Bakhshi v. Baarlaer</a>, 2021 Ohio 13 ¶¶ 68-69 (Ohio App. Jan. 8, 2021). </cite>
</p>

<p>
NOTE: Delaware law distinguishes between "<b>intentional fraud</b>," sometimes stated as "<b>deliberate fraud</b>," versus <b>reckless misrepresentation</b> — the latter doesn't require proof of an intent to deceive. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12055490353831154176">Express Scripts, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-lim-liab-carve-out-gross">
<p>
A carve-out for "gross negligence" <b>could leave it up to a jury</b> to decide whether a defendant had engaged in <i>gross</i> negligence, as opposed to ordinary negligence. This happened in California's <i>Epochal Enterprises</i> case: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A commercial landlord leased dilapidated greenhouse buildings to a tenant.</li>

<li>The landlord knew that the buildings might have asbestos but didn't tell the tenant.</li>

<li>After asbestos was found in one of the leased buildings, the tenant stopped paying rent, vacated the premises, and sued the landlord.</li>

<li>The jury awarded damages to the tenant — but citing an exclusion clause in the lease, a trial court granted "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_notwithstanding_verdict">JNOV</a>" for the landlord notwithstanding the verdict.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>The court of appeals reversed</b> the JNOV, holding that <b>the jury was presumed to have found that the landlord had acted with gross negligence</b> — which was the subject of a carve-out in the lease's limitation of liability. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7607209820558985606">Epochal Enterprises, Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-lim-liab-neg-cmt">
<p>
When a supplier and a customer are each represented in a contract negotiation by an experienced professional, the negotiators' conversation about limitations of liability might go something like this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Customer: Hey, Supplier, why should we agree to limit your liability? Aren't you willing to stand behind your product (or service)?</li>

<li>Supplier: Of course we are. But what we're providing is a product (or service). We're not selling you an insurance policy, and our pricing reflects that fact. AND: Please keep in mind that even if we <i>were</i> providing insurance, every insurance policy ever written has limits on what the carrier will pay out in case of a loss.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A contract could provide for different damages caps for:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<h5 id="lim-liab-risk-by-risk"><span class="section-number-5">23.7.8.7.</span> Pro tip: Try <i>risk-by-risk</i> limitations</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-lim-liab-risk-by-risk">
<p>
Contract drafters can often speed up discussions of liability limitations by breaking up generic boilerplate language into more-concrete statements of risks that are of particular concern, which the parties can focus on more readily.
</p>

<p>
One technique that works well is to list specific categories of risk and, for each category, state what if any liability limits are agreed. The categories of risk could include, for example, the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Personal injury</li>
<li>Tangible damage to property (not including erasure, corruption, etc., of information stored in tangible media where the media are not otherwise damaged)</li>
<li>Erasure, corruption, etc., of stored information <i>that could have been avoided or mitigated</i> by reasonable back-ups</li>
<li>Other erasure, corruption, etc., of stored information</li>
<li>Cost of repair or replacement</li>
<li>Lost profits from any of the above</li>
<li>Lost revenue from any of the above</li>
<li>Indemnity obligations</li>
<li>Infringement of another party's IP rights (including without limitation rights in confidential information)</li>
<li>Willful, tortious destruction of property (including without limitation intentional and wrongful erasure or corruption of computer programs or -data)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To be sure, if the non-drafting party won't care much about the limitation of liability anyway, then including such detailed limitation language could actually hinder the overall negotiations.
</p>

<p>
But remember, by hypothesis we're talking about contract negotiations in which the limitation language is indeed going to be carefully negotiated — in which case this kind of systematic approach will almost always make sense.

<div id="outline-container-lim-liab-time-circum" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="lim-liab-time-circum"><span class="section-number-5">23.7.8.8.</span> Pro tip: Negotiate <i>variable</i> limitations of liability?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-lim-liab-time-circum">
<p>
Exclusions of consequential damages (see <a href="#r-conseq-dam-excl">23.5</a>) and damage-cap amounts (see <a href="#r-dam-cap-gen">23.7</a>) don't necessarily have to be carved in stone for all time. The parties could easily agree to vary them, either as time passed or as circumstances changed.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Suppose that —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A software vendor is negotiating an enterprise license agreement with a new customer for a mature software package.</li>

<li>The customer has successfully completed a pilot project, but it hasn't rolled out the software for enterprise-wide production use.</li>

<li>Knowing how tricky a production roll-out can sometimes be, the customer is concerned about the vendor's insistence on excluding all 'consequential' damages, whatever that really means. (See the commentary to <a href="#r-conseq-dam-excl">23.5</a>: <i>Consequential Damages Exclusion Protocol</i> for a review of the difficulty of determining what constitutes "<i>consequential</i> damages.")</li>
</ul>

<p>
Our vendor might try offering:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to waive the consequential-damages exclusion entirely during, say, the customer's first three months of production use of the software,</li>

<li><i>subject to</i> an agreed dollar cap on the vendor's aggregate liability for all damages — which might be a higher dollar amount than at other times, as discussed below.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This approach could make the customer more comfortable that the vendor is 'standing behind its software' during the roll-out phase.
</p>

<p>
In theory, certainly, the vendor would be exposed to additional liability risk during those first three months. But the business risk might be eminently worth taking.
</p>

<p>
Remember, we're assuming that the software is mature, that is, most of its significant bugs have already been corrected. This means that the vendor might be willing to take on the additional theoretical risk — which in any case would go away after three months — in order to help close the sale.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: As another illustration, perhaps such a vendor could agree that the damages cap would be, say: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>4X for any damages that arise during, say, the first three months of the relationship, or possibly until a stated milestone has been achieved;</li>

<li>3X during the nine months thereafter; and</li>

<li>2X thereafter.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the 4X / 3X / 2X language, X could be defined: as a stated fixed sum; as the amount of the customer's aggregate spend under the contract in the past 12 months, 18 months, etc.; in any other convenient way.
</p>

<p>
The details in the above examples aren't important; the point is that <b>sometimes 'standard' limitation-of-liability language is too broad</b> to allow the parties to specify what they really need. 
</p>

<p>
Negotiators might have more success if they drilled down into the language.

<h5 id="incid-dam"><span class="section-number-5">23.7.8.9.</span> Excluding <i>incidental</i> damages isn't a great idea</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-incid-dam">
<p>
Contracting parties might not want to agree to exclude "incidental damages," which are generally defined as reasonable expenses reasonably incurred by a party incident to a breach or delay by another party. 
</p>

<p>
<i>See generally</i> <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-710.html">UCC § 2-710</a> (seller's incidental damages) and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-715.html">UCC § 2-715</a>(1) (buyer's incidental damages). Of course, UCC Article 2 applies only to sales of goods, and will not apply at all in non-U.S. countries. Still, the same basic concepts of incidental damages might also apply to sales of services, etc.
</p>

<p>
It has been observed that: "Although incidental damages are often included in the laundry list of waived damages, it is often advisable to remove them <i>[from the list of exclusions]</i> since the right to recover incidental damages may encourage mitigation efforts." <cite> Thomas H.

<p>
A.&nbsp; This Protocol says only that the other party will be entitled to <i>seek</i> injunctive relief, <span class="underline">not</span> that the other party will be entitled <i>to the relief sought</i>. 
</p>

<p>
To be sure: Drafters of confidentiality agreements and similar contracts sometimes include flat statements that the drafting party is <i>entitled</i> to injunctive relief. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; Such clauses, however, are often obnoxiously overreaching. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Moreover, courts will often ignore such peremptory statements, as discussed at <a href="#humility">30.18</a> — and possibly even find them unconscionable.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a California case, an employment agreement stated that the company, but not the employee, was <i>entitled</i> to injunctive relief, and without posting a bond (on the subject of a bond waiver, see Protocol <a href="#r-bond-waiver">23.4</a>). An appeals court regarded this as a factor in the agreement's unconscionability. <cite> See <a href="https://cases.justia.com/california/court-of-appeal/2025-b337435.pdf?ts=1749843049">Silva v. Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.</a>, No. B337435, slip op. at 22-23 (Cal. App. Jun. 13, 2025) (affirming trial court’s order finding employer’s arbitration agreement unenforceable and denying employer’s motion to compel arbitration) (citing cases). </cite>
</p>

<p>
It's a non-trivial task for a claimant to prove that it would be irreparably injured — and the claimant might not succeed in carrying its burden of proof. EXAMPLE: In one federal case, a patent owner obtained a preliminary injunction against a would-be competitor. The undisputed facts, though, showed that even in the best-case scenario, the competitor would not be ready to launch its product until several years after the patent had expired. The Federal Circuit overturned the preliminary injunction, on grounds that the patent owner had failed to provide "non-speculative evidence" that it would be irreparably harmed by the competitor's actions. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10605090443784530274">Incyte Corp. v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Ltd.</a>, No. 25-1162, slip op. at 5-6 (Fed. Cir. May 7, 2025). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; So: A potential future target of an injunction request might not want to stipulate to the <i>fact</i>, as opposed to just the <i>possibility</i>, of irreparable harm. Such a stipulation could well absolve the claimant from what might otherwise be a significant challenge of proof.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, if you're reviewing a contract, and you're asked to agree to language in this category, then you should pay careful attention to the exact wording, because it could end up significantly disadvantaging your client. 
</p>

<p>
(See also the commentary to Protocol <a href="#r-bond-waiver">23.4</a> (bond waivers), which likewise can be dangerous to a party that might have to defend against a motion for preliminary injunction or similar equitable relief.)

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-23-10-2-1">
<p>
We're talking here about two main categories of relief from a court: An order for specific performance, or an injunction. Each of those things is, in essence, a court order that the other party must do or not do something — on pain of punishment for contempt of court. (Some forms of such relief might have different labels, e.g., a restraining order.)
</p>

<p>
If a party were to <i>stipulate</i> to such relief — or stipulate to the existence of "irreparable injury" — then that stipulation likely would waive away a major part of what would otherwise be a significant burden of proof for the drafting party. 
</p>

<p>
In the U.S., any party asking for such a court order generally must <i>show</i> — not merely <i>allege</i> — that, among other things, the party has suffered or is likely to suffer "irreparable injury" that could not be adequately compensated by a monetary award. 
</p>

<p>
The Supreme Court of the United States explained how this works:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
According to well-established principles of equity, a plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such relief. 
</p>

<p>
A plaintiff must <i>demonstrate:</i>
</p>

<p>
(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; 
</p>

<p>
(2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; 
</p>

<p>
(3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and 
</p>

<p>
(4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction. The decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court, reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4819344338954570996">eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.</a>, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006) (describing traditional four-factor test in context of patent-infringement injunctions) (citations omitted, emphasis and extra paragraphing added). For a useful catalog of things that <i>might</i> qualify as <i>irreparable injury</i> &#x2013; if proved &#x2013; see Paige Bartholomew, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/commercial-division-judge-reaffirms-82997/">Commercial Division Judge Reaffirms "Most Critical" Element for Injunctive Relief: Irreparable Harm</a> (JDSupra 2020); scroll down to its list of bullet points. </cite>

<p>
In Delaware, parties can agree contractually on the existence of requisite elements of a compulsory remedy, such as the existence of irreparable harm in the event of a party's breach, and, in keeping with the contractarian nature of Delaware corporate law, this court has held that such a stipulation is typically sufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7975340924897187579">Martin Marietta Materials, Inc v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-forum-appl">
<p>
This Protocol presupposes that the Con&shy;tract clearly specifies one or more particular forums for litigation, each, an "<b>Agreed Forum</b>." (The Con&shy;tract could do this explicitly, <span class="underline">or</span> clearly-but-implicitly.)
</p>

<h6 id="orgfbc250b">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgfbc250b">
<p>
A.&nbsp; It's not uncommon for a contract to provide that litigation "arising from" the contract — and perhaps even litigation merely "relating to" the contract — may be brought, or even <i>must</i> be brought and maintained, in a specified forum such as a particular state or city, or even (in the case of New York City) a particular borough. Such a forum-selection provision might <i>or might not</i> be enforceable — and it might not be the best idea anyway — as discussed in the reading beginning at <a href="#nl-forum-sel">23.11.9</a> below.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; To choose a forum, drafters could consider permissive language such as the following: "Any dispute arising out this Agreement may be brought in any state- and/or federal court having jurisdiction in [LOCATION], as stated in more detail in the Lighthouse suite Forum Selection Protocol."
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> See the commentary at <a href="#forum-courts-of-cmt">23.11.9.2</a> and <a href="#forum-no-fed-ct">23.11.9.3</a> for potentially-dangerous wording choices.
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Even <i>proposing</i> a forum-selection clause to a party with superior bargaining power could be "poking a bear," as discussed at <a href="#forum-dog">23.11.9.18</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-forum-defn">
<p>
For purposes of this Protocol:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the term "<b>Action</b>" refers to a lawsuit or other form of contested action in any dispute arising out of the Con&shy;tract; and</li>

<li>the term "<b>sue</b>" refers to bringing an Action.</li>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org38e3c12">
<p>
The choice of "arising out of the Con&shy;tract" is intentional because the quoted term is more limited than "relating to the Con&shy;tract," and it might well not be a great idea to lock in a forum for future disputes that are related only distantly to the contract. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Ride-sharing company Uber was sued by a contractor, Grip, for both breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. Uber asked the court to transfer the case to transferred to Brazil, because the contract (for a pilot project) was with Uber's Brazilian subsidiary and included a forum-selection provision for Brazil. A Massachusetts trial court granted Uber's motion to transfer for the contract-related claims — but not for the statutory trade-secret claims — because the contract stated that "[t]his Agreement shall be <b>governed by and construed</b> in accordance with Brazilian laws without regard to its choice or conflict of laws provisions" and that Grip "consents to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts sitting in the city of São Paolo, state of São Paulo, Brazil." <cite> See <a href="./Zemcar_Decision.pdf">Zemcar Inc. v. Uber Techs., Inc.</a>, No. 2484CV01525-BLS2, slip op. at 17 (Mass. Super. Jan. 29, 2025) (denying, in relevant part, motion to dismiss trade-secret claim because of forum selection clause; emphasis added). </cite>
</p>


<p>
EXAMPLE: In another Massachusetts case, a federal court held that a contract's forum-selection clause <span class="underline">didn't</span> apply to claims asserting common-law and statutory rights; the clause read as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
Likewise, <i>state</i> courts in the U.S. generally honor forum-selection provisions; for example, in <i>Paul Business Systems</i> (Va. 1990), Virginia's supreme court explained that a forum-selection provision would be enforced "unless the party challenging enforcement establishes that <i>such provisions</i> are unfair or unreasonable, or are affected by fraud or unequal bargaining power." <cite> <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=19901201397SE2d804_11178.xml&docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006">Paul Business Systems, Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-forum-courts-of-cmt">
<p>
It's not a good idea to say that the parties agree to have suits heard in the courts "of" the specified forum location. That's because a U.S. court might find that such language precluded the defendant from removing the suit from <i>state</i> court — the courts "of" the forum state — to <i>federal</i> court. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: This happened, for example, in a case where the Fifth Circuit affirmed a federal district court's remand of a <i>removed</i> case to state court in Houston — even though diversity of citizenship existed — because the contract's forum-selection clause required suits to be "brought before the district courts <i>of Harris County, Texas</i>[.]" <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2040336036493187570">Dynamic CRM Recruiting Solutions, L.L.C. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-forum-no-fed-ct">
<p>
A contract required litigation to be in Linn County, Oregon. When one of the contracting parties sued the other one, the defendant removed the case to federal court. But as it happens, there's no <i>federal</i> courthouse located in that county. Consequently, said the Ninth Circuit, the federal trial court correctly remanded the case to state court. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6167585711006106232">City of Albany v.

</p>

<p>
<b>Lesson:</b> If you want your client (and the other side, of course) to be able to remove to federal court, be sure that your forum-selection clause refers to "<i>the state- and federal courts having jurisdiction in</i>" the specified place, versus "<i>in</i>" the specified place.

<p>
In an English case:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Hong Kong freight forwarder used its standard bill-of-lading form in accepting cargo for shipment from China to Venezuela.</li>

<p>
Asking for — or insisting on &#x2013; a forum-selection clause might fall into the category of "be careful what you wish for," because the courts in the forum state might decide matters differently than what you expected.

<h5 id="forum-excl-disad"><span class="section-number-5">23.11.9.6.</span> Tactical disadvantage of an exclusive-forum clause?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-forum-excl-disad">
<p>
An <i>exclusive</i>-forum clause might be <i>tactically</i> disadvantageous — consider this not-so-hypothetical example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You're helping to negotiate a contract between "Ginger" and "Fred."</li>

<li>Your draft contract is a tough one; among other things, it contains an <i>exclusive</i>-jurisdiction forum clause that requires all litigation to be conducted in Ginger's home-court jurisdiction.</li>

<li>At some point after signing the contract, Ginger wants to seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction against Fred. (That might be, for example, because Fred appeared to be violating a confidentiality clause requiring him to keep Ginger's information secret.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that situation, Ginger might well be better off tactically by suing Fred in <i>Fred's</i> own home jurisdiction, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In kicking off the lawsuit, it's likely that Ginger will be able to complete the necessary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_of_process">service of process</a> on Fred more quickly in Fred's own "home court" than in Ginger's jurisdiction.</li>

<li>If Ginger must go to court to compel Fred to produce documents or witnesses, Fred would probably have a harder time resisting an order from a judge in Fred's own home jurisdiction.</li>

<li>Even if Ginger were successful in getting a court to issue an injunction affecting Fred, the injunction likely wouldn't take effect until it had been formally served on Fred, and that service of process might well be quicker and easier in Fred's home jurisdiction.</li>

<li>If Fred violated the injunction, Ginger probably would be able to haul him back more quickly into court for contempt proceedings in his own home jurisdiction.</li>

<li>BUT: By insisting on an <i>exclusive</i>-jurisdiction forum selection clause, Ginger might have precluded suing Fred in Fred's home jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Lesson:</b> Ginger should think twice before insisting that Fred agree to exclusive jurisdiction in <i>Ginger's</i> home court.

Some states' arbitration laws provide that agreement to arbitrate in the state constitutes consent to jurisdiction in the co1urts of the state to enter judgment on the arbitration award. <cite> This is the case in California, for example, under <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1293.&nodeTreePath=6.8.5.2&lawCode=CCP">Cal.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-forum-excl-arb">
<p>
An explicit <i>exclusive</i> forum-selection provision in a contract might be held to trump an arbitration provision, such as Protocol <a href="#r-arb-sop">23.1</a>, in a prior- or "background" agreement, such as the <a href="http://www.finra.org/ArbitrationAndMediation/">arbitration provision</a> in the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), a self-regulatory organization.  At this writing there's <b>a split in the circuits</b> on that point:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The Second and Ninth Circuits have held that an exclusive forum-selection clause <i>does</i> trump the arbitration provision in the FINRA rules. (But as discussed below, a later Ninth Circuit case implicitly called that holding into question.) <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2825828000023343327">Goldman, Sachs & Co. v. Golden Empire Schools Financing Authority</a>, 764 F.3d 210 (2d. Cir. 2014), in which the appeals court affirmed a trial court's grant of Goldman's motion to enjoin FINRA arbitration, on grounds that the forum-selection clauses in the parties' agreements superseded the arbitration provision (hat tip: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-oberman/24/375/340">Michael Oberman</a>); <i>see also</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6666620474436630724">Goldman, Sachs & Co. v. City of Reno</a>, 747 F.3d 733, 736 (9th Cir. 2014), where the appeals court reversed a denial of preliminary injunction and final judgment on the same grounds. <i>Accord:</i> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/23-286/23-286-2024-01-22.html">The Resource Group Int'l Ltd. v.

</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  In a similar vein was a decision by Hawai'i's supreme court, in a case where a condominium purchase agreement stated that venue for litigation would be in a specified court in Hawai'i, but the purchase agreement incorporated a condominium declaration, which contained an arbitration clause. The court ruled that this inconsistency meant that the arbitration clause was unenforceable. (The court also held that the arbitration clause was unconscionable because it prohibited discovery and punitive damages.) <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9463631184036966410">Narayan v. Ritz Carlton Dev. Co.</a>, 100 Haw. 343, 400 P.3d 544 (2015). </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  But in contrast, the Fourth Circuit held that an exclusive forum-selection clause did <i>not</i> trump the arbitration clause in the FINRA rules, on grounds that the forum-selection clause referred to <i>litigation</i>, not arbitration, and "we believe that it would never cross a reader's mind that the <i>[forum-selection]</i> clause provides that the right to FINRA arbitration was being superseded or waived." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=167230553088649015">UBS Fin.

</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Likewise, the Ninth Circuit held that, in Uber's user agreement, the exclusive-forum provision was <i>not</i> incompatible with an arbitration provision, because the forum-selection provision was intended "to identify the venue for any other claims that were not covered in the arbitration agreement." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6844344043375980625">Mohamed v.

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Federal Circuit decision: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  A confidentiality agreement between the parties — we'll call them <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> — contained a forum-selection provision that expressly required any action challenging the validity of <i>A</i>'s patents to be filed in federal court in Delaware.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Notwithstanding this requirement, <i>B</i> filed administrative challenges to the patents (known as "petitions for <i>inter partes</i> review," or IPRs) in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
</p>

<p>
The Federal Circuit held that the forum-selection provision should have been given effect, and that the trial court should have enjoined <i>B</i> from pursuing the IPRs. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=729340133866831937">Nippon Shinyaku Co. v.

But the Indian court proceedings took so long that the Indian company became insolvent, and in the end, the executive got nothing, apart from bills for some £1 million in legal fees from his counsel — so he successfully sued his law firm for malpractice for failing to advise including a forum-selection clause in the draft contract because of the notorious slowness of Indian courts. <cite> See <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/1308.html">Wright v.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
To make things really complicated, although the jurisdictions [in the UK] are distinct, the court system is more 'united' so for your court jurisdiction clause (which should always be paired with the choice of law clause) the correct form is 'the courts of England and Wales' (or Scotland, or Norther[n] Ireland)!

<li>whether the contract meets the language- and governing-law requirements of Chinese law to make the contract enforceable by a Chinese court; and</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-23-11-9-15">
<p>
Anyone dealing with a contract counterparty in Russia needs to consider whether it might get caught in the crossfire of that country's so-called Lugovoy Law, which was enacted in response to international sanctions to punish various actions by the Russian government as well as specified non-state actors — and which threatens serious penalties against violators.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Lugovy Law purports to allow sanctioned parties to sue in Russian courts — that's the case even when the parties have agreed to forum-selection clauses that would have required the disputes to be heard elsewhere.</li>

<li>But some courts outside of Russia have refused to go along: They've entered injunctions prohibiting parties in their cases from going to Russian courts to enforce the Lugovy Law. <cite> See generally Rinat Gareev, <a href="https://tlblog.org/russias-lugovoy-law-and-the-battle-for-jurisdiction/">Russia’s Lugovoy Law and the Battle for Jurisdiction</a> (TLBlog.com 2025). </cite></li>

<p>
If contracting parties don't specify a forum for their disputes, they could be letting themselves in for a fact-intensive court dispute over whether a lawsuit would be proper in a particular state chosen in the heat of a dispute. As a rule, this would mean that the parties could count on having to pay lawyers for depositions, document production, brief-writing, and oral argument, both in the trial court and when the losing party appealed. That's because the existence of "personal jurisdiction" often lies in the eye of the beholder — i.e., a court — unless the parties have previously agreed between themselves on that score. EXAMPLE: This can be seen in a New York case where extensive litigation was required to address the forum question. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5657717117406240475">New York v. Vayu, Inc.</a>, 39 N.Y.3d 330, 206 N.E.3d 1236, 186 N.Y.S.3d 93, 2023 NY Slip Op 00801 (2023) (reversing and remanding dismissal of complaint). </cite>

<h5 id="forum-dog"><span class="section-number-5">23.11.9.18.</span> But: <i>Proposing</i> a forum might be poking a bear</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-forum-dog">
<p>
Suppose that you're drafting a contract and are thinking about where contract-related disputes might be litigated:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you <i>don't</i> include a forum-selection clause in a draft contract (and thereby "roll the dice" about the forum for future lawsuits), then it's at least possible that The Other Side might not even raise the issue.</li>

<li>On the other hand: If you <i>do</i> propose a forum clause —  and The Other Side has more bargaining power — then The Other Side might insist on "flipping" the provision to mandate its own preferred forum. When that happens, <i>possibly</i> the best you can hope for is for The Other Side to agree simply to drop the forum clause entirely.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That happened in one contract negotiation for a routine commercial deal in which I represented a Houston-based vendor:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The vendor was using a contract patched together by its business people before they became a client of mine.</li>

<li>The vendor sent the contract to a prospective customer that had significantly-more bargaining power — and that was based in, let's say Cleveland — but also had significant operations in Houston.</li>

<li>The vendor's contract form included a forum-selection provision requiring all litigation to take place exclusively in Houston.</li>

<li>The customer's lawyer — in Cleveland — saw the forum-selection clause, and said nope, all litigation has to be in Cleveland. That wouldn't have been good for the Houston-based vendor, because litigating in Cleveland would have been costly and inconvenient.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Fortunately, the customer's lawyer went along with my suggestion that we just drop the forum-selection clause entirely. The other lawyer evidently didn't realize that <i>on the facts</i>, this could have turned out to be a win for the vendor, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Without</i> a forum-selection stipulation, the customer likely wouldn't have been able to sue the vendor in Cleveland at all, because the courts in that city would almost certainly wouldn't have had <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/personal_jurisdiction">personal jurisdiction</a> over the vendor. (Of course, that wouldn't have stopped the customer from filing suit anyway, which would have meant that the vendor would have to spend money to get the case dismissed or transferred.)</li>

<li>In contrast, the vendor <i>would</i> have been able to sue the customer in Houston because of the customer's significant operations there — the customer's lawyer apparently didn't tumble to the fact that he was making a potentially-big concession.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="forum-rel-to"><span class="section-number-5">23.11.9.19.</span> Why <i>only</i> "arising out of the Con&shy;tract"?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-forum-rel-to">
<p>
Drafters should be careful about specifying an <i>exclusive</i> forum for proceedings "relating to" the parties' agreement, as opposed to the narrower "arising out of" the agreement as used in this Protocol.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Kannuu Pty Ltd.</i> (2021), the Federal Circuit's decision involved a general, exclusive forum-selection provision, which had caused the parties to have to litigate whether Samsung could challenge the validity of a patent in an <i>administrative</i> proceeding in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, known as an "inter partes review" or "IPR" instead of in the agreed exclusive-forum court. Spoiler: Both the trial- and appeals courts said "yes." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5782763899505552031">Kannuu Pty Ltd. v. Samsung Elec. Co.</a>, 15 F.4th 1101 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (affirming denial of motion for preliminary injunction); cf. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15963663078556466679">DexCom, Inc. v. Abbott Diabetes Care, Inc.</a> , 89 F.4th 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2024) (affirming denial of preliminary injunction; <i>wording</i> of exclusive forum-selection provision <i>allowed</i> filing of IPR). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>But:</b> An even-broader forum selection provision led to the opposite result, as discussed at <a href="#nippon-shiyaku">23.11.9.9</a>.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Consider the following (hypothetical) possibility:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Provider, a company headquartered in Providence (Rhode Island), licenses its software to Customer, in Cumberland (Maryland). <i>(The city names here were chosen for matching initials.)</i></li>

<li>As with many drafter-favoring contracts, Provider's standard software license agreement requires that any litigation "arising out of <i>or relating to</i>" the agreement must be brought in Providence, Provider's home city.</li>

<li>One day, though, Customer rolls out its own software product that performs some of the functions of Provider's software — <i>and</i> Customer's new software bears a trademark that's confusingly similar to Provider's own trademark.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that situation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If Provider wanted to sue Customer <i>for trademark infringement</i>, then Provider might well want to bring the lawsuit in <i>Cumberland</i> because of the better availability of relevant witnesses and documents.</li>

<li>But: Provider might <i>not</i> be able to sue Customer in Cumberland — as Provider would prefer to do in these particular circumstances — because the license agreement required all disputes <i>relating to</i> the license agreement to be brought in Provider's home city of Providence.</li>

<p>
In one contract that I reviewed for a client, a forum-selection clause stated that "disputes <i>are to be resolved</i> in [a particular court]." This is almost a canonical example of a false imperative; Rebecca Tradewell, an attorney for the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, explains that a better way to word such a provision is to state it in terms of a positive obligation: "Any dispute arising out of &#x2026; <i>must be brought and maintained in</i> [the court in question]." <cite> See Becky Tradewell, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/lsss/webinars/shall_outline.pdf">Food Shall Be Pure: Using "shall" carefully for clearer laws</a> (NSDL.org 2013). </cite>

<p>
In many American states, a venue statute specifies the location where a lawsuit must be brought; typically, this will be either the <i>county</i> where the plaintiff resides or the <i>county</i> where the defendant resides.
</p>

<p>
But if a contract's forum-selection clause specifies a <span class="underline">county</span> that doesn't meet the statutory requirement, then a court might refuse to enforce the forum selection. EXAMPLE: This happened in a North Carolina case; the court, though, did note that "a forum selection clause which favored a court <i>in another State</i> was enforceable &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="http://appellate.nccourts.org/opinions/?c=2&pdf=32429">A&D Envt'l Serv., Inc. v.

App. 2015) (affirming denial of defendant's motion to enforce forum-selection clause) (emphasis in original, citation and internal quotation marks omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Another example: Under a California statute (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&sectionNum=116.225.">Cal. Code Civ. Pro. § 116.225</a>), "[a]n agreement entered into or renewed on or after January 1, 2003, establishing a forum outside of California for an action arising from an offer or provision of goods, services, property, or extensions of credit primarily for personal, family, or household purposes that is otherwise within the jurisdiction of a small claims court of this state is contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable."

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-forum-policy-cmt">
<p>
Courts will sometimes refuse to honor a contract's forum-selection clause if the clause offends a strong public policy of the forum location.  Here are a few real-world examples.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A group of users of the America OnLine ("AOL") service sued AOL in California and sought class-action status. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The AOL user agreement required all disputes to be litigated in Virginia.</li>

<li>Citing the forum-selection clause, a federal district court in California dismissed the case but said it could be re-filed in Virginia state courts, as required by the user agreement.</li>

<li>The federal appeals court disagreed, holding that California had a strong public policy favoring class-action relief — and noting that the requested relief was not available in Virginia state courts.</li>

<li>Therefore, said the appeals court, "the forum selection clause in the instant member agreement is unenforceable as to California resident plaintiffs bringing class action claims under California consumer law." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6214815490932232665">Doe 1 v. AOL, LLC</a>, 552 F.3d 1077, 1084 (9th Cir. 2009). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Relatedly, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=925.">California Labor Code § 925</a> "prohibits an employer from requiring an employee who resides and works in California to agree to a provision requiring the employee to adjudicate outside California a claim arising in California." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5800022293518457321">Zhang v. Superior Court</a> (Zhang v. Dentons US LLP), 85 Cal. App. 5th 167, 171 (2022) (denying mandamus). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> In a California case, a Delaware corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws included a mandatory forum-selection provision that designated Delaware's Chancery Court — where a jury trial wouldn't be available — as the exclusive forum for certain litigation. California's supreme court held that the lack of the right to a jury trial wasn't enough — at least not standing alone — to deny enforcement of the forum-selection provision, even though advance jury-trial waivers are constitutionally unenforceable in <i>California</i> courts:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Forum selection clauses serve vital commercial purposes and should generally be enforced. At the same time, courts may properly consider whether enforcement of a forum selection clause would violate public policy. 
</p>

<p>
California has a strong public policy, based on the California Constitution, in favor of the right to trial by jury. 
</p>

<p>
But California’s strong public policy protects the jury trial right in California courts, not elsewhere. It does not speak to the availability of the jury trial right in other forums. A forum selection clause is not unenforceable simply because it requires the parties to litigate in a jurisdiction that does not afford civil litigants the same right to trial by jury as litigants in California courts enjoy. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15175780934148233221">EpicentRX, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. of San Diego Cty</a>, No. S282521, slip op. at 2 (Cal. Jul. 21, 2025) (reversing and remanding denial of mandamus) (extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: Likewise, in a Texas supreme court case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>AutoNation, a Florida-based car dealer, filed suit, in Florida, against a former employee who lived in Texas and had worked for the car dealer there.</li>

<li>The former employee's employment agreement contained a choice-of-law clause calling for <i>Florida</i> law to apply, together with a forum-selection clause requiring any litigation to take place in <i>Florida</i>.</li>

<li>Before learning of the Florida action, the former employee sued the car dealer in <i>Texas</i>, seeking a declaratory judgment that the non-competition covenant of the employment agreement was unenforceable under prior Texas supreme court precedent.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Granting a writ of mandamus, the Texas supreme court ruled that while it was not questioning the validity of its prior precedent, it would still enforce the "freely negotiated" <i>[sic]</i> forum-selection clause to allow first-filed suit in Florida to proceed. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11784087501632923472">In re AutoNation, Inc.</a>, 228 S.W.3d 663 (Tex. 2007). </cite>
</p>

<p>
QUESTION:   On the <i>AutoNation</i> facts, what are the odds that the <i>Florida</i> court would have applied <i>Texas</i> law, given that the contract included a Florida choice-of-law clause?
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Sixth Circuit case, the contract in suit was between a Michigan countertop fabricator and a Minnesota manufacturer of stone slabs used to make countertops. The contract's forum-selection provision required all lawsuits to be brought in a <i>Minnesota</i> state court. The Michigan company filed suit in a federal district court in <i>Michigan</i>. The trial court granted the Minnesota company's motion to dismiss, citing the contract's forum-selection clause, but the appeals court reversed, on grounds that Michigan Franchise Investment Law invalidated the clause. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=286459648460584236">Lakeside Surfaces, Inc. v. Cambria Company, LLC</a>, 16 F.4th 209 (6th Cir. 2021) (reversing and remanding dismissal of Michigan-filed lawsuit). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A California appeals court held that the state's usury laws, while complicated, represented a fundamental public policy of the state that trumped a loan agreement's forum-selection provision. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13765037985319887426">G Companies Management, LLC v. LREP Arizona LLC</a>, 88 Cal. App. 5th 342 (2023) (reversing order enforcing forum-selection clause). For additional discussion and case citations, see generally Paulo B.

(For more on usury law, see <a href="#nl-usury">9.11.6</a>.) ]
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In Texas, if a contract relates broadly to real property located in Texas and is entered into after September 1, 2025, then (with certain exceptions) a forum-selection clause requiring litigation in the courts of another state is void as against public policy — ditto for governing-law clauses choosing the law of another state, and arbitration clauses requiring arbitration in another state. <cite> Under the former version of the statute, a state court of appeals held that if the forum-selection clause included a waiver of voidability, then that waiver would be enforced; three years later, the Legislature responded by changing the wording to preclude that result.

<p>
EXAMPLE: As explained by the Fifth Circuit: Under the "closely-related" doctrine, <i>non-signatories</i> to the contract might be <i>bound by</i> — and conversely, might be able to <i>enforce</i> — a forum-selection clause "where, under the circumstances, the non–signatories enjoyed a sufficiently close nexus to the dispute or to another signatory such that it was foreseeable that they would be bound." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4735599746187072398">Franlink Inc. v.

<p>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: In <i>Firexo</i> (6th Cir. 2024), the appeals court essentially rejected the "closely related" doctrine — after extensive analysis, including analogizing to arbitration law — but ultimately ducked the question on grounds that the parties' choice of <i>English</i> law precluded resort to the doctrine. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14381800313376401474">Firexo, Inc. v.

<p>
COUNTEREXAMPLE: Arizona's supreme court rejected the "closely related" doctrine on grounds that "under Arizona law, third-party beneficiaries must be explicitly named in the contract to enforce the contract’s provisions," and the defendant was not a named beneficiary and so could not rely on the contract's forum-selection provision. <cite> See <a href="https://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/0/OpinionFiles/Supreme/2025/CV240215PR.pdf">Henderson v.

<p>
Editorial comment: It'd be one thing if the Idaho court had tossed out the contracts' respective choice-of-<i>law</i> provisions as well as the choice-of-<i>forum</i> provisions, on grounds that otherwise, the parties' bargained-for results would have violated Idaho public policy as expressed in Idaho's choice-of-forum statute. <cite> See <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title29/t29ch1/sect29-110/">Idaho Code § 29-110</a>, <i>quoted in</i> <i>Off-Spec Solutions</i>, slip op. at 7. </cite>
</p>

<p>
But let's just say it's &#x2026; unusual to assert that <i>California's</i> or <i>Texas's</i> law somehow requires an Idaho court to concern itself with <i>Idaho's</i> public policy.

<p>
<i>Drafting lesson:</i> If doing business with an Idaho company, don't expect your forum-selection provision to be given effect by an Idaho court —  so be prepared to race to your preferred courthouse if it looks as though litigation is on the horizon.

A.&nbsp; Lawyers, and even clients, can sometimes casually throw around allegations of fraud, for tactical reasons discussed in more detail at <a href="#RelDisclBkgd">22.34.6.7</a>. Such allegations can make litigation (and arbitration) much more complicated and costly. To streamline legal proceedings when fraud-like allegations are made, this Protocol is intended to lock in the usual American standard of proof in civil cases.

A.&nbsp; It's quite common for contracts to specify a law to govern the contract as a whole, or possibly just one specific clause of a contract. That's because under the "party autonomy rule" in the United States (and some other jurisdictions), parties can agree — within limits — that their contract will be governed by the law of another jurisdiction. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9135932681763019162">Great Lakes Insurance SE v.

Subdivision 2: To illustrate how <i>renvoi</i> (French for "send back") works, let's consider the following hypothetical example:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Two giant oil companies company — let's call them Flexxon and Blevron — each have operations in New Orleans but are headquartered in Houston.</li>

<li>The two companies enter into a contract under which they will explore for oil.</li>

<li>The contract is negotiated in Louisiana, and all the work under the contract is to take place in Louisiana.</li>

<li>But the contract between the companies calls for <i>Texas</i> law to apply, because Flexxon and Blevron are both headquartered in Houston and their lawyers are more familiar with Texas law.</li>
</ol>

<p>
On these facts, Texas choice-of-law rules <i>might</i> call for the application of <i>Louisiana</i> law in a lawsuit, because Louisiana might be the state with the closest relationship to the parties' dealings. <cite> See generally, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_laws_in_the_United_States">Conflicts of laws in the United States</a> (Wikipedia.com). </cite>
</p>

<p>
That's why subdivision 2 includes the phrase, "without regard to &#x2026; choice-of-law rules" phrase; this is known as disclaiming <i>renvoi</i>. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1317384802443530733">American Ins.

But if instead a choice-of-law clause is drafted more narrowly — for example, to cover only to the <i>interpretation</i> and <i>enforcement</i> of a contract — then the chosen law will probably <i>not</i> be applied to <i>tort</i>-based claims such as claims of misrepresentation, e.g., of fraudulent inducement to enter into the contract.

</ul>

<p>
An arbitrator held that, because the contract's choice-of-law provision didn't apply to <i>noncontract</i> claims, the Pennsylvania statute's remedies were available to the client.

<p>
The arbitrator awarded treble damages under the Pennsylvania statute; a trial court in Massachusetts upheld the (sizeable) arbitration award. <cite> See <a href="http://www.sacarbitration.com/SLAOnlineCases/2015_SLA/46/SLC_2015-46-01.pdf">Family Endowment Partners, L.P. v.

<li>The company failed to pay commissions on certain sales; the sales rep sued, with the lawsuit including a <i>non</i>-contract claim (quasi-contract, to be precise).</li>

A federal appellate court held that the sales rep's <i>non-contract claim</i> did <span class="underline">not</span> require construction or enforcement of the terms of the agreement — and so <i>Maine</i> law, not California law, would govern that claim.

<p>
The differences between New York and California contract law turn out to align with the formalist/contextualist distinction in contract theory. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>New York judges are formalists. Especially in commercial cases, they have little tolerance for attempts to rewrite contracts to make them fairer or more equitable, and they look to the written agreement as the definitive source of interpretation.</li>

<li>California, on the other hand, is more willing to reform or reject contracts in the service of morality or public policy; it places less emphasis on the written agreement of the parties and seeks instead to identify the contours of their commercial relationship within a broader context framed by principles of reason, equity and substantial justice.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both approaches to contract law are commendable. Both serve important social goals and employ sophisticated and well-reasoned doctrines in the service of those ends. This article takes no position on whether one is better than the other. 
</p>

<p>
What is clear, however, is that contracting parties do take a position on this question. <b>The testimony of the marketplace</b> — the verdict of thousands of sophisticated parties whose incentives are to maximize the value of contract terms – is that <b>New York’s formalistic rules win out over California’s contextualist approach</b>. As predicted by theory, <b>sophisticated parties prefer formalistic rules</b> of contract law. #+end_quot <cite> Geoffrey P.

<p>
Delaware law gives parties wide latitude to enter into contracts as they see fit — the state's courts are very reluctant to put a thumb on the scale without a compelling reason. In <i>RSUI Indem.</i> (Del. 2021), the state's supreme court quoted an oft-cited chancery-court decision about party autonomy:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
When parties have ordered their affairs voluntarily through a binding contract, Delaware law is strongly inclined to respect their agreement, and will only interfere upon a strong showing that dishonoring the contract is required to vindicate a public policy interest even stronger than freedom of contract. Such public policy interests are not to be lightly found, as the wealth-creating and peace-inducing effects of civil contracts are undercut if citizens cannot rely on the law to enforce their voluntary-undertaken mutual obligations. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11743862959658705539">RSUI Indem.

Specifying a particular law that you want to govern your contract, or your contractual relationship, could lead to unexpected — and possibly-undesired — results. Here are some real-world examples:
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A group of individuals, working <i>in New York</i> as couriers for a Massachusetts-based company, sued the courier company in Massachusetts for unpaid overtime. The company had drafted its contract form to specify that Massachusetts law would apply and that all litigation must be in Massachusetts. So, these New-York based couriers claimed to be entitled to the protection of <i>Massachusetts</i> statutes governing independent contractors, wages, and overtime. The Massachusetts supreme court held that <b>it would not be unfair to enforce the courier company’s own forum-selection and governing-law choices against the company</b>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10474110454285764501">Taylor v.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A <i>Florida</i>-based, remote-working employee of a Massachusetts company successfully sued the company's CEO — personally — for more than $100,000 in unpaid wages and expense reimbursements, among other amounts. The employee did so under a Massachusetts statute that created the right of action, in part because the remote worker's employment agreement stated that <i>Massachusetts</i> law applied. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10258061612300686154">Dow v. Casale</a>, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 989 N.E.2d 909, 913 (2013) (affirming summary judgment in favor of former employee). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A federal court in Oklahoma, considering the same Massachusetts statute, dismissed the class-action claims filed by two remote employees; in <i>that</i> case, the employment agreement didn't include a choice-of-law provision. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3108583093285383199">Goode v.

<p>

<p>
A pharmaceutical company owned a patent but did a "Samson in the temple" move to the patent. Why did it do that? Because it had entered into an agreement with another pharma firm that required it to pay royalties on its own product, and it wanted to get out from under that obligation. (To explain further would require getting into the weeds of patent law, and it's not important in any case.) The contract between the two pharma companies stated that Delaware law would govern. 
</p>

<p>
The other firm sued for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. But the Delaware supreme court said, basically, <i>tough</i>: Under Delaware's "contractarian" approach, said the court, "[t]he implied covenant &#x2026; is a limited and extraordinary legal remedy and not an equitable remedy for rebalancing economic interests that could have been anticipated. It cannot be invoked when the contract addresses the conduct at issue." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6587312515760085993">Glaxo Group Ltd. v.

<p>
Section <a href="#gov-law-arise">23.13.3</a> is a broad one — contrasting with narrower language such as in a Second Circuit case:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Under New York law, in order for a choice-of-law provision to apply to claims for tort arising incident to the contract, the express language of the provision must be sufficiently broad as to encompass the entire relationship between the contracting parties. 
</p>

<p>
In the case at hand, the choice-of-law provision in the parties' mortgage document stated only that "[t]his Mortgage shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts." We see no way such language can be read broadly enough to apply to fraudulent misrepresentation. Thus, the district court properly looked to the jurisprudence of New York to determine the body of law properly applicable to the present controversy. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17699596013869626522">Krock v. Lipsay</a>, 97 F.3d 640, 645 (2d Cir. 1996) (cleaned up). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
More recently, from the Southern District of New York:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Here, the Agreement's choice-of-law provision provides the governing law only for the contract. It states: "This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed under, the laws of the State of Delaware, all rights and remedies being governed by said laws." 
</p>

<p>
Plaintiff argues that the "all rights and remedies" phrase broadens the scope of the clause and reflects an intent to apply Delaware law to extra-contractual claims. However, when read in context, that language is explanatory, indicating that the substantive law of Delaware will apply exclusive of its choice of law principles. The provision expressly provides that "This Agreement" is what is governed by Delaware law. * * * Accordingly, New York law governs the tortious interference claim. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15438452727747721">Manbro Energy Corp. v.

The parties' choice of law clause provides that: "[t]his Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of California." * * * The parties' narrow choice of law clause does not address the entirety of the parties' relationship, however, and hence does not end our inquiry. Caton's other claims for relief involve the tort duty of good faith and fair dealing and a claim for restitution under quantum meruit, and, as such, do not arise out of the contract. Because the choice of law clause does not address the general rights and liabilities of the parties, we must return to Texas choice of law rules to determine which law applies. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8053696305416885467">Caton v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-gov-law-which">
<p>
Drafters wondering which governing law to choose should give some thought to the specifics of the laws being considered.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Several years ago, I started a <a href="http://www.oncontracts.com/cheat-sheets/choice-of-law-crib-sheet/">choice-of-law cheat sheet</a> for U.S. states that might be helpful (although I haven't worked on it in a long time).</li>

<li>In international transactions, a party from a jurisdiction with a civil code (e.g., continental Europe; Latin America) might be reluctant to agree to the law of a common-law country (e.g., England and its former colonies), or vice versa. In that situation, the UN CISG, discussed at <a href="#gov-law-excl">23.13.5.11</a>, might be an acceptable "neutral" choice.</li>

<li>English law is often chosen for multi-national transactions. <cite> See, e.g., Melanie Willems, <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/uk/contracts-and-commercial-law/329242/english-law-a-love-letter">English Law – a Love Letter</a> (mondaq.com 2014), which contrasts England’s common-law foundation with the civil law found on the Continent ]</li>

<li>Different laws might be suited for different industry categories. <cite> See generally Thierry Clerc, <a href="https://www.eurojuris.net/en/node/43725">International Contracts: From choosing applicable law to settling disputes</a> (EuroJuris.net 2016), archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/U54S-QMBH">https://perma.cc/U54S-QMBH</a>. </cite></li>

<li>Choosing the law in a given country might require, in case of dispute, translation into whatever language is used in the lawsuit or arbitration; that can add to the expense.</li>

<h5 id="gov-law-forum"><span class="section-number-5">23.13.5.7.</span> Choose the law of the agreed forum?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-gov-law-forum">
<p>
If the parties are also going to agree to a choice of forum — about which see <a href="#r-forum-sel">23.11</a> — then they might want to choose the law of that agreed forum as their agreed governing law. That could increase the chances of having their choice of law enforced in a dispute.
</p>

<p>
For example: the parties might agree to New York law, in part to take advantage of the statutory provision validating clauses requiring amendments to be in writing in certain contracts (see <a href="#r-amend-defn">2.2</a> and its commentary). A New York court would seem to be more likely to give effect to that provision, and thus to an amendments-in-writing clause, than might a court in another jurisdiction.

A law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong writes that:

<p>
Chinese courts have long been said to display a "homeward trend" in applying Chinese law, the lex fori, instead of foreign law in foreign-related civil litigations. Coined by Nussbaum in 1932, the term "homeward trend" refers to “a tendency to arrive, if possible, at the application of domestic law” in the courts’ judicial search for the applicable legal system. This homeward trend is frequently criticized by commentators, who regard it as a form of local protectionism. It damages the credibility of Chinese courts and erodes the confidence of foreign investors. In addition, it encourages forum shopping and causes unfairness to defendants. <cite> King Fung Tsang, <a href="https://journals.library.wustl.edu/globalstudies/article/id/8754/">An Empirical Study on Choice of Law in China: A Home Run?</a>, 21 Wash.

It's not uncommon for contracting parties to exclude, e.g., the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("<a href="http://cisgw3.law.pace.edu/cisg/text/treaty.html">U.N. CISG</a>" or "Vienna Convention"). That convention, in some ways, amounts to an international version of the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code, with nontrivial differences, surveyed in a Wikipedia article. <cite> See generally the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_Contracts_for_the_International_Sale_of_Goods">Wikipedia article on the U.N. CISG</a>; for a comparison of the UCC and the CISG, see John C. Tracy, <a href="http://knowledgetonegotiate.blogspot.com/2011/07/ucc-and-cisg.html">UCC and CISG</a> (Jul. 5, 2011). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Professor John Coyle reports that when American companies' contracts mention the CISG at all, the vast majority exclude the CISG, with only a tiny fraction explicitly adopting it. Moreover, "[a] substantial number of U.S. attorneys have no idea that the CISG exists. These attorneys are unaware that they must opt out of the treaty if they want their international sales contracts to be governed by domestic sales law." <cite> John F. Coyle, <a href="https://tlblog.org/cisg-opt-outs-and-party-intent/">CISG Opt-Outs and Party Intent</a> (TLBlog.com 2022). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Another possible exclusion is the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act ("UCITA"), which is (was?) a controversial proposed uniform law that was enacted only in Maryland  and Virginia, and but otherwise appears to be a dead letter. <cite> See generally the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Computer_Information_Transactions_Act">Wikipedia article</a> on UCITA ]

<h5 id="gov-law-bkgd"><span class="section-number-5">23.13.5.12.</span> How do U.S. courts decide what law to apply?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-gov-law-bkgd">
<p>
Let's illustrate with an example in which a contract lawsuit is brought in a court in a given state — for example, a court in New York state. <b>The judge will naturally apply the law of that state</b> (that is, New York law) unless one or another party asserts that the law of a different jurisdiction should apply. Then it's up to the asserting party to convince the judge that New York law allows the other jurisdiction's law to govern.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  If no party raises the governing-law issue, then the (New York) court likely will apply New York law, on grounds that the parties waived application of another jurisdiction's law. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Suppliers in Argentina sued a buyer of food products, operating in New York, for payment of $100,000 in past-due invoices On the facts, the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("CISG," discussed briefly at <a href="#gov-law-excl">23.13.5.11</a> ) clearly applied — but no one seems to have made that point, so the court applied New York law without comment. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14012951485966774430">Salteña S.A.U. v. Ercomar Imports Internacional Corp.</a>, No. 21-CV-4675, slip op. at part IV.A (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2024) (granting default judgment against buyer), discussed in John F. Coyle, <a href="https://tlblog.org/overlooking-the-cisg/">Overlooking the CISG</a> (TLBlog.com 2024). See also Clayton P. Gillette, <a href="https://blogs.law.nyu.edu/transnational/2011/04/implicit-exclusion-of-cisg/">Implicit Exclusion of CISG</a> (law.nyu.edu 2011). </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  If <i>federal</i> law doesn't govern, and the contract states that State A's law will apply, then a judge in State B will probably go along with that statement — that is, unless the statement is inconsistent with a fundamental policy of State B's  law; see <a href="#gov-law-probl-cmt">23.13.5.13</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  If the contract <i>doesn't</i> specify a choice of law, one or another party might still assert that another jurisdiction's law should apply. In that situation, <b>many courts follow the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws</b> to determine just which law to apply.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Tenth Circuit concluded that Colorado would follow the Restatement; in a very-readable exposition, the court explained why, in the court's view, Colorado's law governed an advance waiver and release agreement. (This took place in a tragic case in which an outdoor-adventure participant, trying to rappel from a quarry, got stuck hanging upside down on the rope and died from positional asphyxia.) <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2361452056841973467">Hamric v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-gov-law-probl-cmt">
<p>
A court might not give effect to a governing-law clause in a contract if doing so would lead to a result that contravened a fundamental public policy of the law of the jurisdiction in which the court sits. Here are some examples:
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: An employment agreement between a New York company and a New York-based employee included a non-solicitation provision, as in, <i>no soliciting our customers after you leave the company</i>. The employment agreement said that <i>Florida</i> law would apply, because the New York company was a subsidiary of a Florida-based company. New York state's highest court ruled that the enforceability of the non-solicitation provision was to be judged by <i>New York</i> law, not Florida law — even though the employment agreement said otherwise. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12927330327141679277">Brown & Brown, Inc. v. Johnson</a>, 25 N.Y.3d 364, 34 N.E.3d 357, 12 N.Y.S.3d 606 (2015) (affirming, in pertinent part, judgment that choice-of-law clause was unenforceable in respect to non-solicitation clause). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A medical-device sales representative quit his job in Arizona and started working for a direct competitor of his former company. The company filed a lawsuit in federal court in Arizona, seeking to enforce a non-competition covenant that was contained in the sale rep's employment agreement with the company. In the lawsuit, the company asked the court for an immediate temporary restraining order (TRO) to prohibit the sales rep from working for the company's competitor. The court, though, refused to grant the restraining order requested by the company:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The court recognized that the employment agreement's governing-law clause specified that the law of Washington state would apply (<i>not</i> the law of Arizona).</li>

<li>But, said the court: On this subject, the laws of Arizona gave more weight to employees' right to earn a living than did Washington-state law — and that was an area of fundamental public policy for Arizona law.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Consequently, the court refused to give effect to the agreement's choice of <i>Washington-state</i> law; the court went on to hold that, under <i>Arizona</i> law, the sales rep's non-competition covenant was unenforceable, regardless of whether it might be enforceable under Washington-state law. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17995886739076358627">Pathway Medical Technologies, Inc. v.

<p>
EXAMPLE: A California truck driver filed a lawsuit, in federal court in California, against the Texas-based trucking company for which he worked. The driver's claim was that the trucking company was violating California employment law by not paying overtime and not reimbursing certain expenses. The driver's contract with the company, though, specified that <i>Texas</i> law would apply; the contract also asserted that the driver was an independent contractor, not an employee of the trucking company. A federal appeals court held that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>State</i> courts in California would not give effect to the contract's choice of Texas law, but instead would apply California law;</li>

<li>Under <i>California</i> law (said the federal appeals court), <i>in reality</i> the driver was an employee of the trucking company and not an independent contractor, no matter what the contract purported to say.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, said the court, the driver could properly sue the trucking company in California for violating California employment law, notwithstanding the contract's contrary provisions. <cite> See <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18394214241619035573">Narascyan v.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <a id="org69fc9da"></a> A Maine-based sales representative was employed by a California company. The sales rep's employment agreement included a California choice-of-law clause. The company failed to pay commissions on certain sales. A federal appeals court held that <i>Maine</i> law governed — and therefore the sales rep was entitled, not only to back commissions, but also to treble damages and attorney fees under a Maine statute. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8939003010713170455">Dinan v. <i>A</i> Networks, Inc.</a>, 764 F.3d 64 (1st Cir. 2014) (vacating trial-court judgment that applied California law after jury verdict in favor of sales rep). </cite>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In two &#x2026; <i>unusual</i> holdings in different cases, the Idaho supreme court ruled that a contractual choice of a <em>non</em>-Idaho state's law, and a requirement that all disputes be heard in that state, somehow required the dispute to be heard &#x2026; in Idaho. <cite> See the discussion at <a href="#forum-sel-idaho">23.11.9.25</a>. </cite>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
A contract for the leasing and servicing of drilling equipment includes a mutual indemnity agreement that complies with Texas law but would be unenforceable under Wyoming’s blanket ban. 
</p>

<p>
Although the agreement states that Texas law will govern, most of the work performed under the contract occurred <i>in Wyoming</i> with <i>none in Texas</i>. 
</p>

<p>
<i>And indemnity is being sought for a Wyoming lawsuit filed by a Wyoming resident injured in a Wyoming oilfield operated by a Wyoming business</i>. We must decide whether the <i>Texas</i> or <i>Wyoming</i> Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act applies. #+end_quot <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12771035179587601486">Cannon Oil and Gas Well Services, Inc. v.

<p>
Contrary to the above examples, a court might give effect to a contract's choice of law even if a party claimed that the choice contravenes a fundamental public policy.
</p>

<p>
For example, the Texas supreme court held that it was permissible for ExxonMobil to choose New York law for its employee stock-option and restricted-stock programs, because multi-national companies should be able to choose the laws they want to follow, in the interest of uniformity. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8078814383068280133">Exxon Mobil Corp. v.

</p>

<p>
(OK, the "choose the laws they want to follow" part does overstate the Texas supreme court's holding just a bit, but not by much; the court arguably opened the door for corporations to purport to impose onerous terms and conditions on their employees while using a choice-of-law clause to strip the employees of their legal protections.)

<p>
It might seem strange to specify a choice of law to govern one particular provision in a contract, such as <a href="#r-amend-defn">2.2</a> (amendments), but it’s not unheard of. For example:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The 1988 update to the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws states that "the parties may choose to have different issues involving their contract governed by the local law of different states." The comment cites a 1980 Maryland supreme court case in which loan documents for a real-estate project adopted local Maryland law for interest- and usury issues but New York law for others. <cite> See Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws, comment i to § 187, citing <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=434371063787351614">Kronovet v. Lipchin</a>, 288 Md. 30, 415 A.2d 1096 (1980). </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  In its famous <i>Akorn</i> (2018) decision, the Delaware chancery court observed: "The parties &#x2026; chose <i>Delaware</i> law to govern the Merger Agreement <i>(excluding internal affairs matters governed by Louisiana law)</i> &#x2026;.." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9672696128127274408">Akorn, Inc. v.

(Emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  An international contract might specify that it is to be governed by the laws of, say, Brazil, but that any arbitration is to be "seated" in England, which might well mean that the arbitration proceedings would be governed by English law. That was precisely the holding of an English court of appeals in a 2012 decision. <cite> See <a href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/638.html&query=Sulamerica+v.+Enesa">Sulamerica CIA Nacional De Seguros SA & Ors v Enesa Engenharia SA & Ors</a>, [2012] EWCA Civ 638, discussed in Sherina Petit and Marion Edge, <a href="https://pdf4pro.com/view/the-governing-law-of-the-arbitration-agreement-q-amp-a-285a31.html">The governing law of the arbitration agreement Q&A</a>, in Norton Rose Fulbright, Int’l Arbitr.

The term "<b>gross negligence</b>" refers to conduct that evinces a reckless disregard for or indifference to the rights of others — tantamount to intentional wrongdoing, and differing in kind, not only in degree, from ordinary negligence.

A.&nbsp; When a contract contains a limitation of a party's liability, the limitation often includes a "carve-out" to the effect that liability is <i>not</i> limited if the party is guilty of gross negligence. Similarly, indemnification provisions such as Protocol <a href="#r-indem-defn">16.3</a> often exclude indemnity coverage for gross negligence. So it'd be useful to have a reference definition:

<p>

</p>

<p>
It is the public policy of this State, however, that a party may not insulate itself from damages caused by grossly negligent conduct. This applies equally to contract clauses purporting to exonerate a party from liability and clauses limiting damages to a nominal sum. &#x2026; Gross negligence, when invoked to pierce an agreed-upon limitation of liability in a commercial contract, must smack of intentional wrongdoing. It is conduct that evinces a reckless indifference to the rights of others. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16981234065134701926">Sommer v.

<p>
(11) "Gross negligence" means an act or omission:

In the U.S., the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment">Seventh Amendment</a> to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to a jury trial in all "common law" cases (there's also a $20 claim amount). Many contracts, though, state that this right is waived; when a party wants to include a jury-trial waiver in a contract, the party typically doesn't want the expense and uncertainty of being judged by a semi-random group of citizens who likely won't be particularly knowledgeable about the subject matter.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-23-16-7-1">
<p>
In probably the vast majority of jurisdictions, the legislative body has enacted a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations">statute of limitations</a>" and/or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_repose">statute of repose</a>" to set a deadline for bringing a lawsuit after a claim "accrues."  <b>But:</b> Often, the law allows parties to a contract to agree to a <i>shortened</i> limitation period in which a claim can be brought, <i>subject to certain limits</i>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-725">Section 2-275</a>(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code allows parties to a contract for the sale of goods to shorten the limitation period for claims of breach of contract, <i>but not to less than one year</i> ]

<h5 id="lim-pd-ext"><span class="section-number-5">23.16.7.2.</span> Can a limitation period be <i>extended</i> by agreement?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-lim-pd-ext">
<p>
Some contracts try to extend, not shorten, the limitation period for a party (usually just one party) to bring contract-related claims, e.g., by stating that the cause of action won't "accrue" until specified events have occurred.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <b>That won't work in New York</b>: Under that state's law (which often governs M&A agreements), when a contract contains "reps and warranties," a limitation period for breach of contract begins on <i>the date of</i> the misrepresentation or breached warranty — and parties <b>may not</b> use a contractual "accrual clause" to state that the limitation period won't begin to run until specified conditions precedent have been met. New York's Court of Appeals (that state's highest court) explained this in a 2015 decision. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=52415138628671678">ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc.</a>, 25 N.Y.3d 581, 36 N.E.3d 623, 15 N.Y.S.3d 716 (2015) (affirming dismissal of complaint as untimely). <i>ACE Securities</i> was followed in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2252982863216097315">Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Flagstar Capital Markets Corp.</a>, 32 N.Y.3d 139, 12 N.E.3d 1219, 88 N.Y.S.3d 96 (2018) (affirming dismissal of complaint as untimely), <i>discussed in</i> Jennifer Fiorica Delgado, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/is-new-york-or-delaware-more-protective-5593352">Is New York or Delaware More Protective of the Freedom to Contract? Two Important New York Decisions on the Accrual of Breaches of Representations and Warranties May Shed Light</a> (JDSupra.com 2022). </cite>
</p>

<p>
(The court distinguished cases in which <i>future performance</i> was warranted, as opposed to when the warranty is about a <i>present state of affairs</i>; this is discussed in more detail at <a href="#nl-warr-present-vs-future">28.43.8</a>.)
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  In contrast, <b>Delaware law might allow parties to agree to just such a postponement</b> of the "accrual" of the claim, as explained decision by that state's chancery court. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8765645658271011481">Bear Stearns Mtg.

</p>

<p>
In fact, under a 2014 Delaware statutory amendment, when a written contract involves at least $100,000, the contract may extend the limitation period “provided <i>[the claim]</i> is brought prior to the expiration of 20 years from the accruing of the cause of such action." <cite> <a href="https://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c081/#8106.">10 Del.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-lim-bring">
<p>
Much contract-related litigation arises from claims of breach of representations and warranties (see <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">18.2</a>) made in contracts. 
</p>

<p>
This is especially relevant in asset sales, mergers, and similar transactions, where the contract typically contains representations and warranties — which under the contract will often be stated to have been made <b>both</b> (i) on the date of <i>signing</i> of the contract; <b>and</b> (ii) on the date of <i>closing</i> the transaction.
</p>

<p>
The latter possibility might be because, at the closing, the representing party is typically required by the contract to sign and deliver a so-called "bringdown certificate" — otherwise, the other party won't be obligated to close the deal. See, e.g., section 7.2(a) of the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/927628/000119312524042826/d780383dex21.htm">Agreement and Plan of Merger</a> under which Capital One is acquiring Discover Bank:

<i>The following is a "cleaned up" quotation, essentially verbatim, from the Delaware supreme court's</i> Schurder <i>opinion.</i> <cite> From <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8910380078616679191">LGM Holdings, LLC v. Schurder</a>, No. 314, 2024, slip op. at 22-23, text accompanying nn.58-65 (Del.

</p>

<p>
Under the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, a statute of limitations can be disregarded when a defendant has fraudulently concealed from a plaintiff the facts necessary to put the plaintiff on notice of the truth. Under this doctrine, a plaintiff must allege an affirmative act of "actual artifice" by the defendant that either prevented the plaintiff from gaining knowledge of material facts or led the plaintiff away from the truth.
</p>

<p>
Where a plaintiff has proved that the defendant fraudulently concealed facts necessary to put the plaintiff on notice, the statute of limitations or survival period governing a claim will be tolled. Tolling suspends or stops the running of a limitations period—it is analogous to a clock stopping and then restarting. The rationale for this doctrine is to disallow a defendant from taking advantage of his own wrong in preventing a plaintiff from filing a timely suit in the courts.
</p>

<p>
Fraudulent concealment does not, however, toll a statute of limitations or survival period indefinitely. Delaware courts have consistently held that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment does not toll a statute of limitations or survival period beyond the point where the plaintiff was objectively aware, or should have been aware, of facts giving rise to the wrong. Put differently, the limitations period begins to run when the plaintiff is objectively aware of the facts giving rise to the wrong, i.e. on inquiry notice.

A.&nbsp; Drafters of limitation-of-liability clauses will often go into some detail about how broadly the parties intend for the clause to apply. To save time and money (for both the drafter and the other side's reviewer), the following clause provides a standardized statement to that effect. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <i>Categories</i> of liability caps are becoming "a thing," especially when it comes to liability for data breaches. <i>Example:</i> Authors from one of the largest Canadian law firms noted: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
1.  <b>Separate liability caps.</b> One of the most significant findings of the <i>[recent]</i> study was the widespread use of separate liability caps for data breaches. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>About 75% of agreements imposed a cap on data-related liability,</li>

<li>and of those, 65% featured a distinct cap for data issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This approach reflects the heightened risk of data breaches while avoiding unlimited liability, allowing parties to bridge the gap between a general limitation of liability and the reality of potentially catastrophic data losses. <cite> Alexandra Luchenko, Ellie Marshall, Robert Percival, and Karl Qin, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/data-liability-in-technology-contracts-8691409">Data Liability in Technology Contracts: Insights from Recent Trends</a>, item 1 (JDSupra.com 2025) (extra paragraphing and bullets added). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-23-18-1-1">
<p>
The term "liquidated damages" refers to an approach where parties to a contract stipulate, at the time they enter into the contract, what "dollar amount" of damages is to be awarded in case of a breach of the contract. That way, if a breach does happen, <i>in theory</i> the parties needn't litigate the amount of the monetary recovery. 
</p>

<p>
Relying on freedom-of-contract principles, courts in the U.S. will enforce a liquidated-damages clause <span class="underline">if</span> the clause genuinely represents a <i>reasonable</i> advance estimate of the amount of damages that would be suffered in case of breach. 
</p>

<p>
As then-Judge Richard Posner said in a 2004 opinion: "One could even think of a liquidated damages clause as <b>a partial settlement</b>, as in cases in which <i>damages</i> are stipulated and <i>trial</i> confined to liability issues. And of course <i>settlements are favored</i>." <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13928518142598429564">American Consulting, Inc. v. Hannum Wagle & Cline Engineering, Inc.</a>, 136 N.E.3d 208 (Ind. 2019) (affirming, in pertinent part, summary judgment that liquidated-damages clause was unenforceable; remanding for trial of claim for <i>actual</i> damages). </cite>

<h6 id="nl-liq-dam-pen-dist">Liquidated damages? Penalty? Which is it?</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-nl-liq-dam-pen-dist">
<p>
The Supreme Court of Ohio once explained the difference between liquidated damages and penalties:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
[A penalty is] a sum inserted in a contract, <b>not</b> as the measure of compensation for its breach, <b>but rather as a punishment</b> for default, or by way of security for actual damages which may be sustained by reason of nonperformance, and it involves the idea of punishment. 
</p>

<p>
A penalty is an agreement to pay a stipulated sum on breach of contract, <b>irrespective</b> of the damage sustained. Its essence is a payment of money stipulated as <i>in terrorem</i> of the offending party, 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>while <b>the essence of liquidated damages is a genuine covenanted pre-estimate</b> of damages.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The amount is fixed and is not subject to change; 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>however, if the stipulated sum is deemed to be a penalty, it is not enforceable</li>
<li>and the nondefaulting party is left to the recovery of such actual damages as he can prove.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="nl-liq-dam-not-pen">Saying "and not as a penalty" won't convince a court</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-nl-liq-dam-not-pen">
<p>
In some contracts, the liquidated-damages provision proclaims that the party breaching the contract will pay a stated amount as liquidated damages <i>and not as a penalty</i>. See, e.g., section 10.5.2 of the 2000 "<a href="https://contracts.onecle.com/drugstore/amazon.sales.2000.01.24.shtml">Agreement</a>" between Amazon and Drugstores.com, which states in part:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
10.5.2  Liquidated Damages for Breach. Upon termination by ACI for drugstore.com's breach pursuant to Section 10.2, drugstore.com will immediately pay ACI, <i>as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty</i>, such amount as mutually agreed <i>[sic]</i> by the Parties. 
</p>

<p>
Upon termination by drugstore.com for ACI's breach pursuant to Section 10.2, ACI will immediately pay, <i>as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty</i>, such amount as mutually agreed <i>[sic]</i> by the Parties.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Emphasis and extra paragraphing added.) And yes, "Agreement" is the title of the contract — which isn't especially helpful, is it?
</p>

<p>
It's even worse than that: By not specifying how the amount of damages is to be computed, the drafters made this clause worthless — not to mention that the "such amount <i>as mutually agreed</i>" language makes the clause an unenforceable agreement to agree (see <a href="#ktok">6.6</a>).
</p>

<p>
Many <i>courts</i>, however, simply ignore such "not as a penalty!" language as self-serving, in roughly the same vein as "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!" from the movie <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A California appellate court noted that "public policy <i>[about liquidated damages]</i> may not be circumvented by words used in a contract; that whether or not a particular clause is a penalty or forfeiture or a bona fide provision for liquidated damages depends upon the actual facts existing at the time the contract is executed &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10997690557780472132">Purcell v. Schweitzer</a>, 224 Cal. App. 4th 969, 974 169 Cal. Rptr. 3d 90 (2014). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-liq-dam-cfg">
<p>
Drafters looking to create a liquidated-damages provision should think about the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Which party could be liable for liquidated damages?</li>

<li>What type(s) of breach would result in liability for liquidated damages? (Example: Delay in completion.)</li>

<li><i>How much</i> would the liquidated damages be? Fill in a <i>reasonable</i> estimate of the damages that would be suffered from the specified type(s) of breach; this will require need some thought, for reasons discussed in the additional notes below.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And just saying "such amount as the parties agree" almost certainly won't cut it, because it'd be an unenforceable agreement to agree; see <a href="#ktok">6.6</a>.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Liquidated damages based on <i>revenue</i>, not <i>profit</i>, might be enforceable. <cite> EXAMPLE: See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5361068226153598483">RSA 1 L.P. v.

Drafters might want to consider setting up an alternative-performance structure instead of liquidated damages. For example:

<p>
&#x2013;  EXAMPLE: What amounts to an early-termination fee was upheld in a 2014 First Circuit case, where the court of appeals affirmed a summary judgment that Alasko, a Canadian food distributor, owed Foodmark, a U.S. marketing firm, a fee for electing not to renew the parties' "evergreen" agreement. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12310247180652076741">Foodmark, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  EXAMPLE: A California appeals court reversed and remanded a summary adjudication that certain payment provisions in a contract were an unenforceable penalty; the court held that "the trial court erred because More-Gas's motion for summary adjudication failed to eliminate the possibility that the contractual provisions in question were instead valid provisions for alternative performance." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9833228731376290048">McGuire v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-liq-dam-looks">
<p>
Caution counsels contract drafters to assume that their liquidated-damages clauses will be judged by a court in a so-called "second look" jurisdiction. 
</p>

<p>
The difference between the "second look" approach and that used by "single look" courts was explained by Massachusetts's highest court:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  In a "single look" jurisdiction, "a liquidated damages clause will be enforced if (1) the actual damages resulting from a breach were difficult to ascertain at the time the contract was signed; <b>and</b> (2) the sum agreed on as liquidated damages represents <i>a reasonable forecast</i> of damages expected to occur in the event of a breach."
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  In contrast, in "second look" jurisdictions, courts consider "the circumstances <i>at the time of the breach</i> &#x2026;. allow[ing] for an after-the-fact adjustment to avoid a windfall for the party not committing the breach by <i>assessing the reasonableness against the actual damages</i> resulting from the breach."
</p>

<p>
The court reiterated that <b>Massachusetts is a single-look jurisdiction</b>, because:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<i>[With a single-look analysis:]</i> By assigning a specific value to a contract breach ahead of time, a liquidated damages clause has the potential to promote certainty, resolve disputes efficiently, and, notwithstanding the instant case, avoid litigation. 
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the second look approach encourages an aggrieved party to bring suit and attempt to show evidence of damage due to a contract breach. 
</p>

<p>
That is, under the second-look approach, the parties must fully litigate (at great expense and delay) that which they sought not to litigate. 
</p>

<p>
For this reason, we have squarely rejected the second look approach.
</p>

<p>
* * * 
</p>

<p>
When parties agree in advance to a sum certain that represents a reasonable estimate of potential damages, they exchange the opportunity to determine actual damages after a breach, including possible mitigation, for the peace of mind and certainty of result afforded by a liquidated damages clause. In such circumstances, to consider whether a plaintiff has mitigated its damages not only is illogical, but also defeats the purpose of liquidated damages provisions. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13126187313768086775">Cummings Prop., LLC v. Hines</a>, 492 Mass. 867, 868, 872 (2023) (cleaned up, formatting revised). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
<b>Texas is a second-look jurisdiction</b>. the Supreme Court of Texas held that for a liquidated-damages clause to be enforceable:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>actual damages must be difficult to estimate, and the agreed liquidated damages must be a reasonable forecast of the actual damage; <i>but also:</i></li>

<li>if <i>in practice</i> the actual damages and the agreed liquidated damages end up being too far apart, then the liquidated-damages provision will be struck down as a penalty.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that case, the Texas supreme court noted that the highest <i>actual</i> damages supported by the evidence was $6 million, but the liquidated-damages amount assessed by the court below was $29 million. The court said that this was an unacceptable disparity: "When the liquidated damages provisions <i>operate</i> with <i>no rational relationship</i> to actual damages, thus rendering the provisions unreasonable in light of actual damages, they are unenforceable." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7330062268051629213">FPL Energy, LLC, v. TXU Portfolio Management Company, L.P.</a>, 426 S.W.3d 59,69-70, 72 (Tex. 2014) (reversing court of appeals and holding that liquidated-damages provision was unenforceable) (emphasis added, citations omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: To like effect, the Seventh Circuit rejected a claim for liquidated damages for breach of a confidentiality provision in a settlement agreement:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The liquidated-damages provision required a payment of $10,000 for each unauthorized disclosure of the terms of the settlement agreement.</li>

<li>The party accused of breaching the confidentiality provision had included detailed information about the settlement in a franchise disclosure document that was distributed to about 2,000 people, not all of whom were required by law to be given a copy.</li>

<li>The plaintiff sued for liquidated damages of <b>2,000 times $10,000, or $20 million</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Applying Texas law, the trial court held that this was unreasonable, because <b>the plaintiff had not proven that she had suffered any harm at all, let alone $20 million worth</b>.

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Under our well-established rules of contract, the Surrender Agreement’s liquidated damages provision does not fairly compensate plaintiff for defendant’s delayed installment payments. The provision calls for a sum <i>more than sevenfold</i> the amount due if defendant had complied fully with the Surrender Agreement. We cannot enforce <i>such an obviously and grossly disproportionate award</i> without offending our State’s public policy against the imposition of penalties or forfeitures for which there is no statutory authority. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14301937649932434267">Trustees of Columbia Univ. v.

<p>
EXAMPLE: As another example of what <span class="underline">not</span> to do: In an <b>Indiana</b> case, the state supreme court affirmed striking down the liquidated-damages clauses in question for breach of an employment agreement's post-employment covenant. The covenant required the employee agreed not to solicit the employer's customers or recruit the employer's employees; the court summarized those clauses:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
He agreed that if he breached this agreement and such a breach resulted in termination, withdrawal or reduction of a client's business with ASI, he would pay liquidated damages in an amount equal to <i>45% of all fees and other amounts that ASI billed</i> to the customer during the twelve months prior to the breach. 
</p>

<p>
The contract further precluded Knowles from causing an employee to end their employment with ASI, and if he breached this provision, he agreed to pay liquidated damages equal to <i>50% of the employee's pay</i> from ASI during the twelve months prior to the breach.
</p>

<p>
Day and Lancet, who were both resident project representatives at ASI, also executed agreements that <i>precluded them from hiring or employing ASI employees.</i> They agreed that if they breached their agreements, they would pay liquidated damages in an amount equal to <i>100% of that employee's pay from ASI</i> during the twelve months prior to breach.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The court did not see much correlation between the liquidated damages and the actual damages that the non-breaching party was likely to have suffered. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13928518142598429564">American Consulting, Inc. v. Hannum Wagle & Cline Eng'g, Inc.</a>, 136 N.E.3d 208, 209-10, 212 (Ind. 2019) (affirming, in pertinent part, summary judgment that liquidated-damages clause was unenforceable; remanding for trial of claim for <i>actual</i> damages) (formatting edited). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-LiqDamagesRetroView">
<p>
In contrast to the holdings discussed above, some courts discourage the use of hindsight in assessing liquidated-damages provisions. EXAMPLE: In a case involving a public-works contract, the <b>Ohio</b> supreme court explained:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
{¶ 35} We reaffirm that Ohio law requires a court, when considering a liquidated-damages provision, to examine it in light of what the parties knew at the time the contract was formed.
</p>

<p>
If the provision was reasonable at the time of formation and <i>it bears a reasonable (not necessarily exact) relation</i> to actual damages, the provision will be enforced.
</p>

<p>
{¶ 36} This prospective or "front end" analysis of a liquidated-damages provision focuses on the reasonableness of the clause <i>at the time the contract was executed</i> rather than looking at the provision retrospectively, i.e., ascertaining the reasonableness of the damages with the benefit of hindsight after a breach.
</p>

<p>
The prospective approach properly focuses on whether[:] 
</p>

<p>
(1) the parties evaluated, at the time of contract formation, the probable loss resulting from delay in completing the construction, 
</p>

<p>
(2) the parties clearly intended to use liquidated damages in case of a delay because actual damages would be difficult to ascertain, and 
</p>

<p>
(3) <i>[in per-diem cases,]</i> the parties reached an agreement as to a per diem amount for delays. 
</p>

<p>
[P]rospective analysis resolves disputes efficiently by making it unnecessary to wait until actual damages from a breach are proved and eliminates uncertainty and tends to prevent costly future litigation. The reasonableness of the forecast or estimate in a liquidated-damages provision is usually determined in view of the facts known at the time of contracting, and not at the time of the breach or delayed completion. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13234931211010226663">Boone Coleman Constr., Inc. v. Village of Piketon</a>, 2016 Ohio 628 (Ohio), ¶ 35-36 (reversing holding that liquidated-damages clause in a public road construction contract was an unenforceable penalty; quotation altered, extensive citations omitted), <i>on remand</i>, 2016 Ohio 1557 (Ohio App.). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>





<p>
In the same case where he talked about liquidated damages as "a partial settlement," Judge Richard Posner mused:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, even if damages <i>wouldn't</i> be difficult to determine after the fact, it is hard to see why the parties shouldn't be allowed to substitute their own ex ante determination for the ex post determination of a court. Damages would be just another contract provision that parties would be permitted to negotiate under the general rubric of freedom of contract. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16794775007946987004">XCO Int'l, Inc. v. Pacific Scientific Co.</a>, 369 F.3d 998, 1001 (7th Cir. 2004) (Posner, J.). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
Judge Posner's view was quoted in a dissent by an Indiana supreme court justice, who argued that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Rather than condemning such [liquidated] damages when judges conclude they are facially problematic, courts should get out of the business of deciding whether the parties' estimate of the harm underlying liquidated damages is reasonable. &#x2026; This approach to liquidated damages here would have the virtue of honoring the parties' freedom of contract, including their settlement of a disputed issue it has taken our Court more than a year to resolve. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13928518142598429564">American Consulting, Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-23-18-1-8">
<p>
EXAMPLE: The Eleventh Circuit reviewed a provision in a confidentiality agreement to the effect that, if a party received confidential information from a discloser and violated the agreement's restrictions, then the recipient must pay the discloser all of the recipient's profits arising from the violation. Affirming a lower-court decision, the court held that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The formula employed in § 5 of the MCA [Mutual Confidentiality Agreement] <b>is not a reasonable method for approximating the probable loss</b> because it is based entirely on the breaching party’s profits, and not on the injury suffered by the non-breaching party. &#x2026; This discrepancy <b>directly contravenes the traditional principle</b> of contract law that damages should put the injured party in the position he would be in had the contract been performed. The liquidated damages provision here stands that principle on its head because it places SIS, the nonbreaching party, in a far better position than it would have been if the contract had never been breached by Stoneridge. 
</p>

<p>
For example, under § 5 of the MCA, SIS is entitled to “all forms of compensation or benefits which [Stoneridge] directly or indirectly realizes as a result of such breach.” <b>This liquidated damages provision therefore resembles a disgorgement remedy,</b> meaning that it permits a plaintiff to recover the defendant’s profits from breach, even if they exceed the provable loss to the plaintiff from the defendant’s defaulted performance, <b>which is not an available remedy for breach of contract under Georgia law.</b>
</p>

<p>
Because § 5 of the MCA gives SIS all direct or indirect profits earned by Stoneridge irrespective of the actual profits that SIS lost, it does not provide a reasonable pre-estimate of the probable loss. This liquidated damages provision instead functions more like a penalty than a reasonable pre-estimate of the probable loss. &#x2026; <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11509647549302263235">SIS, LLC v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-nl-liq-dam-stat">
<p>
Drafters should check whether a relevant jurisdiction might have statutory constraints on liquidated damages. For example, section 92.019 of the Texas Property Code restricts a residential landlord's right to charge late fee for late rent payment, in terms that sound very much like liquidated damages:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
(a) A <i>[residential]</i> landlord may not charge a tenant a late fee for failing to pay rent unless:
</p>

<p>
       (1) notice of the fee is included in a written lease;
</p>

<p>
       (2) the fee is a reasonable estimate of uncertain damages to the landlord that are incapable of precise calculation and result from late payment of rent; and
</p>

<p>
       (3) the rent has remained unpaid one full day after the date the rent was originally due.
</p>

<p>
(b) A late fee under this section may include an initial fee and a daily fee for each day the rent continues to remain unpaid. <cite> <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PR/htm/PR.92.htm#92.019">Tex. Prop. Code § 92.019</a>. </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Fifth Circuit, making an <i>Erie</i> guess about how Texas courts would interpret the statute, held that "a reasonable estimate" did not require a landlord to engage in advance in any kind of process to develop the estimate.

Eventually Minaj made an offer of judgment under Rule 68, proposing to settle the case by paying Chapman $450,000; Chapman accepted the offer. <cite> See Anastasia Tsioulcas, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/954853692/tracy-chapman-wins-lawsuit-against-nicki-minaj">Tracy Chapman Wins Lawsuit Against Nicki Minaj</a> (NPR.org Jan. 8, 2021). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-settle-motiv">
<p>
Lawyers can often be overly-optimistic about their prospects at trial, as pointed out in a 2020 article by an experienced in-house counsel:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
One study found that when <b>plaintiffs</b> rejected a settlement in favor of going to trial, <b>they fared worse than the settlement offer 61 percent of the time</b>.  
</p>

<p>
When plaintiffs were wrong, it cost an average of US$43,000.  In other words, the settlement offer the plaintiff rejected was, on average, US$43,000 more than the amount awarded at trial. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Defendants</b>, while faring worse at trial than the rejected offer only 24 percent of the time, <b>paid more dearly</b> for being wrong — US$1.1 million on average. * * *  &#x2026; Lawyers may be particularly susceptible to optimism bias because of their ethical duty to zealously advocate for their clients, causing them to more readily adopt narratives that support their client’s best arguments and theories, <b>potentially blinding them</b> to other, possibly more important, believable, or persuasive narratives. <cite> Brian W. Jones, <a href="https://www.accdigitaldocket.com/accdocket/october_2020/MobilePagedArticle.action?articleId=1623866&app=false#articleId1623866">With the Advancement of Predictive Analytics, Consider Using FRCP 68 During Litigation</a>, ACC <i>[Association of Corporate Counsel]</i> Docket, Oct. 2020, at 56, 60, 61 (ACCDigitalDocket.com) (footnotes omitted, emphasis and extra paragraphing added). </cite>

A somewhat-better approach than Federal Rule 68 is <a href="https://casetext.com/rule/new-jersey-rules-of-court/new-jersey-rules-of-court/njr-ct-part-iv/part-iv-rules-governing-civil-practice-in-the-superior-court-tax-court-and-surrogates-courts/rule-458-offer-of-judgment">New Jersey Court Rule 4:58</a>, which shifts not just court costs but also attorney fees. (The New Jersey rule, however, applies only when exclusively-monetary relief is sought; this Protocol doesn't contain such a restriction.) 
</p>

<p>
To like effect are the various branches of <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code/2020/677.pdfhttps://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code/2020/677.pdf">Iowa Code chapter 677</a>; concerning that statutory scheme, Iowa's supreme court noted: "When, as here, the plaintiff recovers less at trial than the amount of the offer, the statute bars recovery of its attorney fees incurred after the rejected offer to confess." <cite> <a href="https://cases.justia.com/iowa/supreme-court/2021-19-0241.pdf">NCJC, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
An empirical study published in 2006 by two law professors suggests that the New Jersey rule seems to encourage early settlement and to reduce attorneys' fee expenses, without affecting the size of the damage award for cases that do go to trial. <cite> See Albert Yoon and Tom Baker, <a href="http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1698&context=faculty_scholarship">Offer-of-Judgment Rules and Civil Litigation: An Empirical Study of Automobile Insurance Litigation in the East</a>, 59 Vanderbilt L. Rev. 155 (2006). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-23-21-6-3">
<p>
A related concept is implemented in Arizona's compulsory-arbitration program for small-dollar disputes: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In any civil case where the amount in controversy is less than an amount set by court rule (not more than $65,000), the court is normally required to send the case to arbitration.</li>

<li>Relevant here: A party that 'loses' the arbitration can still demand a trial de novo in court. If the result of the trial de novo, however, is not at least 23% (??) better than the arbitration award, then the party demanding the trial must pay (i) the arbitrators' fee, <i>and</i> (ii) the other side's costs and attorney fees and expenses for the trial de novo. <cite> See <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/ars/12/00133.htm">Arizona Rev. Stat. 12-133</a>. </cite></li>

The Arizona compulsory arbitration statute has come under criticism; a pilot program giving parties an alternative option for a shortened courtroom trial, known as FASTAR, is in progress at this writing. <cite> See Christian Fernandez, <a href="https://arizonastatelawjournal.org/2019/11/19/arizonas-compulsory-arbitration-program-is-it-time-for-a-reform/">Arizona’s Compulsory Arbitration Program: Is It Time for a Reform?</a> (ArizonaStateLawJournal.org 2019). </cite>

</p>

<p>
"Efficient breach" is the notion that, at least in the eyes of the law, it's OK for you to <i>intentionally</i> breach a contract, as long as you're willing to pay for the other party's resulting damages.  (On the other hand, the other party — and others who hear about it — might not want to do business with you if you're someone who can't be relied on to stand behind the contractual commitments you make.)
</p>

<p>
DCT note: I ran into a related issue a few years ago with a small, software-company client that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>was being acquired by a big Silicon Valley company, the "buyer"; and</li>

<li>had a significant, ongoing contract with another very-big company, the "customer."</li>
</ul>

<p>
The contract — which I hadn't been involved in negotiating — was on an over-aggressive customer standard form; it said that my client couldn't even reveal to others the existence of the client's contract with the customer, let alone of the terms of the contract.
</p>

<p>
My client's contract with the customer was "material" for my client, but likely wouldn't have been material for either the customer or the buyer. 
</p>

<p>
My client told its prospective buyer, in vague terms, that there was a contract that the buyer would be entitled to review under the terms of the acquisition agreement. But the buyer didn't want to reveal to anyone that the buyer was looking to acquire my client, so the client didn't approach its customer to get permission to disclose the contract to the buyer.
</p>

<p>
So the question was: Could my client reveal the existence of its customer contract to the buyer, during the buyer's due diligence, <span class="underline">without</span> the customer's consent —  notwithstanding the prohibition in the contract?
</p>

<p>
My client decided to take an "efficient breach" position: The client revealed a redacted version of the contract to its buyer, on the theory that if my client's customer took the position that this was a breach of the contract by my client, then the customer's damages would be nominal at best. 
</p>

<p>
Things worked out fine: My client was acquired by its buyer; the client eventually told its customer about the disclosure of the redacted contract, and the customer didn't have a problem with it.
</p>

<p>
The UK Supreme Court has noted that "[c]ontract law permits efficient breach and the defendant may therefore profit from its wrong." <cite> <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2025/39">King Crude Carriers SA v.

<p>
An intent to provide an exclusive remedy may be clearly indicated with terms stating that the remedy is the "only," "sole," or "sole and exclusive" remedy. &#x2026; <b>In the absence of such limiting terms</b> or some other language which displaces the remedies that might otherwise be available, <b>courts uniformly hold</b> that a party may pursue <b>any remedy that the law affords in addition to the remedies provided in the contract</b>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12568712110326248552">GRCDallasHomes LLC v.

<p target="UCC">
Under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-719" target="UCC">section 2-719</a> of the [U.S.] Uniform Commercial Code, a contract for the sale of goods can specify that a remedy is exclusive (but there are restrictions and exceptions to that general rule).
</p>

<p>
A real-world example of this supplier approach is found in the First Circuit's 2014 <i>BAE v. SpaceKey</i> decision: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A supplier delivered lower-quality integrated circuits ("ICs") to a customer than had been called for by their contract. The supplier had previously alerted the customer in advance that the ICs in question would not conform to the agreed specifications; the customer accepted the ICs anyway. (The customer later asserted that it assumed the supplier would reduce the price.)</li>
<li>The customer refused to pay for the nonconforming ICs.</li>
<li>The supplier terminated the contract and sued for the money due to it.</li>
<li>The customer counterclaimed — <i>but it did not first invoke any of the contract's specified remedies</i>, namely repair, replace, or <i>credit</i> (as opposed to refund).</li>
</ul>

<p>
For that reason, the trial court granted, and the appellate court affirmed, summary judgment in favor of the supplier. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6891595016363212898">BAE Sys.

<p>
When one company (buyer) acquires another (seller), the contract pretty much always contains certain representations and warranties by the seller. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The seller might want the contract also to include an exclusive-remedies provision — that way, if any of the seller's reps and warranties turn out to be inaccurate, then the buyer's exclusive remedies will be for the seller to indemnify (reimburse) the buyer for (foreseeable) losses caused by the inaccuracy unless the buyer can prove fraud.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The <i>buyer</i> might want just the opposite, namely a statement that indemnification is <i>not</i> the buyer's exclusive remedy.

Agreeing to binding, neutral, expert determination of a factual issue — for example, determining the amount of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/percentage-lease.asp">percentage rent</a> that a store in a mall owes to its landlord — can help parties streamline dispute resolution.
</p>

<p>
Importantly, expert determination and arbitration are not the same thing; in one case, the Third Circuit vacated and remanded an order compelling <i>arbitration</i> of an earn-out dispute, because the parties' contract called for <i>expert determination</i> of the dispute. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3208810295747873381">Sapp v. Indus. Action Svcs., LLC</a>, 75 F.4th 205 (3d Cir. 2023) (cleaned up, extra paragraphing added); see also, e.g., Andrew Judkins, <a href="https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/knowledge/publications/470a3448/use-of-expert-determination-mechanisms">Expert determination</a> (2023). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The following explanation is adapted from the <i>Sapp</i> court's opinion; no copyright is claimed in the opinion text.
</p>

<p>
Arbitration and expert determination, in most states, are two distinct forms of private alternative dispute resolution that produce binding results. They have similarities, leading some commentators to call them "close cousins" and some courts struggling to apply the differences between them.
</p>

<p>
Despite these similarities, the fundamental difference between the two methods is the type and scope of authority that is being delegated by the parties to the decision maker.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  On the one hand, arbitration occurs when the parties intend to delegate to the decision maker authority to decide all legal and factual issues necessary to resolve the matter. The arbitrator functions like a judge in a judicial proceeding.  
</p>

<p>
For example, like a judge, the arbitrator cannot meet with either party alone and must afford parties the due process protections of adversarial proceedings.
</p>

<p>
After resolving all factual and legal questions in a formal process that mirrors a judicial proceeding, the arbitrator can award a legal remedy, such as damages or injunctive relief, that courts will enforce. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  By contrast, experts decide narrower issues using a less formal process. Under this method, the parties appoint a person or entity with specialized knowledge, usually of a technical nature, to determine a confined issue.
</p>

<p>
The authority of an expert is limited to its mandate to use its specialized knowledge to resolve a specified issue of fact and does not extend to making binding decisions on issues of law or legal claims. It makes its decision without following court-like procedures: there are usually no pleadings, evidentiary hearings, or the taking of witness testimony.
</p>

<p>
Rather than rely only on evidence submitted by the parties, an expert will often conduct its own investigation and request from the parties the information it needs to resolve the factual issue.
</p>

<p>
As relevant here <i>[i.e., in the case being appealed]</i>, accounting firms are commonly relied on as experts to resolve questions about post-merger financial schedules.

In a Delaware trial-court case: Del. Super. Ct. 2024: <a href="https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=367900">Pazos v. AdaptiveHealth LLC</a>: "Pursuant to those procedures, an independent accountant was tasked with resolving the parties’ post-closing calculations dispute. The agreement’s provisions state that the independent accountant’s determination is final and binding upon the parties, absent manifest error." <cite> Slip op. at 14: Accountant True-Up Mechanism. </cite>
</p>

<p>
What's "manifest error"?  P.17, TAN 96:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
A manifest error has been referred to as a plain and obvious error, or an error which is obvious or easily demonstrable without extensive investigation. Too, manifest error should be confined to errors which are obviously capable of affecting the determination. <i>[Cleaned up, citations and footnotes omitted.]</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At 18-19 n.102:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The Independent Accountant shall determine and include in its report an award of the costs of its review and report based on the extent to which the Parties prevail in such matter. By way of illustration, if the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of Seller’s position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Buyer and 40% of the costs would be borne by Seller. Buyer and Seller shall make available to the Independent Accountant all relevant books and records relating to the calculations submitted and all other information reasonably requested by the Independent Accountant.
</p>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; According to Ms. Pazos, the Court can simply re-calculate and enter judgment. See id. While it might be more efficient, the Court cannot substitute its own decision-making for that of the expert where the parties specifically bound themselves by contract for the use of an expert to settle disputes. The Court’s role is limited here to determining whether manifest errors occurred— not determining the post-closing payment calculations themselves. See Tenenbaum Living Tr., 682 F.Supp.3d at 355 (“A manifest error clause avoids [the peril of a court’s erroneous financial computations] by requiring courts not to make such determinations themselves but rather to defer to qualified experts selected by the parties.”); id. (“for manifest error clauses to properly serve their function, they must preclude courts from reexamining the substantive correctness of the determination to which the clause applies”).

Following the Delaware Supreme Court’s decision in Terrell v. Kiromic Biopharma, Inc.87 and the Court of Chancery’s decision Penton Business Media Holdings, LLC v. Informa PLC,88 Delaware courts have applied the “authority test” to determine whether parties have opted for arbitration.89 “The test turns primarily on the degree of authority delegated to the decision-maker.”90 In a plenary arbitration, the arbitrator has authority “to decide all legal and factual issues necessary to resolve the matter.”91 By contrast, an expert determination is typically limited “to deciding a specific factual dispute concerning a matter within the special expertise of the decision maker, usually concerning an issue of valuation.”92

In a 2019 decision, Delaware's chancery court explained that : "Expert determination provisions are fundamentally different from arbitration provisions.

<p>
<b>Critical Mediation Provision Drafting Tips</b>
</p>

<p>
The following three tips can help avoid a result like <i>Healy</i>:
</p>

<p>
<b>First, use express “condition precedent” language.</b> Explicitly state that mediation is a “condition precedent” to litigation or arbitration. Avoid ambiguous terms like “endeavor” or provisions that allow inconsistent actions, such as simultaneously requesting mediation and filing suit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Second, prohibit filing until mediation concludes.</b> Clearly define when mediation is considered “complete” — whether through mediator declaration of impasse, expiration of a specific timeframe, or mutual agreement. This eliminates ambiguity about when parties may proceed to litigation. Third, establish consequences for noncompliance.* Include provisions allowing parties to recover attorneys’ fees if they must move to dismiss a prematurely filed action. This reinforces the mandatory nature of the mediation requirement. <cite> Jamey Collidge, Robert Gallagher, and Patrick Zancolli, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/court-rules-mediation-clause-lacks-8022767">Court Rules Mediation Clause Lacks Condition Precedent Language: Key Lessons for Construction Contracts</a> (JDSupra.com 2025), <i>discussing</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13373419161432238109">Healy Long & Jevin, Inc. v.

<p>
Background: For various reasons — e.g., plaintiff convenience, congenial law, friendly juries — a plaintiff that wants to sue a corporation might bring the lawsuit in the local courts of a particular state, e.g., Texas, Delaware, California etc. But: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the plaintiff is a citizen of one state and the corporation is a  a "citizen" of another state (other than the state where the lawsuit was brought), then the corporation can "remove" the lawsuit to federal court. The federal court would then hear the case under the court's "diversity jurisdiction," as provided in the U.S. Constitution's <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artIII-S2-C1-16-1/ALDE_00013239/#:~:text=The%20current%20diversity%20jurisdiction%20provision,amount%20in%20controversy%20exceeds%20%2475%2C000.">Article III, section 2, clause 1</a>.</li>

<li>Congress has fleshed out the diversity concept by legislating that, for diversity purposes, a corporation is a "citizen" of the state where it's incorporated <b>and</b> (if different) the state of its "principal place of business." <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332">28 U.S.C. § 1332</a>(c)(1) </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
But what does "principal place of business" mean, exactly: The state where the corporation has its physical headquarters? The state where the corporation does the mosst business? Something else?
</p>

<p>
In <i>Hertz Corp.</i> (U.S. 2010), resolving a circuit split, the Supreme Court adopted the Seventh Circuit's "nerve center" approach:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
We conclude that "principal place of business" is best read as referring to the place where a corporation's officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation's activities. It is the place that Courts of Appeals have called the corporation's "nerve center." And in practice it should normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquarters — provided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordination, i.e., the "nerve center," and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings (for example, attended by directors and officers who have traveled there for the occasion). <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17027901767103590274">Hertz Corp. v.

<p>
The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) has special requirements for releases of claims under that statute. 38 U.S.C. § 4302.

From a Sixth Circuit case:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
The relevant language here is that Ward agreed to release "any and all claims whatsoever" as to his termination. <b>Those words speak for themselves:</b> to know that the release applied to Ward's USERRA claim, one needed to know only that it was a claim.

<p>
The district court was mistaken to conclude otherwise. The court reasoned that, since the release did not call out Ward's USERRA claim specifically, the release did not apply to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>But the law does not require contracting parties to enumerate, one by one, all the objects they intend a particular clause to reach.</b> That kind of requirement would generate litigation rather than prevent it—by opening the door to disputes later about whether an item was described clearly enough, for example, or about circumstances not expressly foreseen at the time of signing.

<p>
In cases of sexual harassment, workplace discrimination, and the like, many settlement agreements have required the complainant to keep quiet, both about the settlement and about the conduct that led to the underlying complaint. BUT: A number of states have enacted legislation restricting or even prohibiting such nondisclosure requirements ("NDAs"). As explained by attorneys at the Littler Mendelson firm: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
New York is not alone. A growing number of other states have also passed laws that significantly restrict or prohibit employers’ use of NDAs when resolving claims of sexual harassment. California, Illinois, Maryland, <i>[Maine,]</i> Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington have all enacted legislation that restrict an employer’s use of NDAs. California, Nevada, and New Jersey now prohibit NDAs altogether when resolving a sexual harassment claim. These new laws do not restrict the right of the parties to agree to keep confidential the terms of a settlement agreement, the amount paid, or the fact that such an agreement exists. Rather, the laws target the parties’ agreement not to disclose the underlying harassment allegations. <cite> Emily Haigh and David M. Wirtz, <a href="https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/metoo-defense-nondisclosure-agreements">#MeToo: In Defense of Nondisclosure Agreements</a> (Littler.com 2020). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In 2023, New York enacted even-stricter legislation rendering certain provisions unenforceable in a settlement agreement for claims of discrimination, discriminatory harassment, and retaliation. <cite> See Robert Hingula, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-year-new-severance-and-settlement-2835143/">New Year, New Severance and Settlement Agreement Rules for New York</a> (JDSupra.com 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
And from an attorney at the Foley & Lardner firm:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Effective June 9, 2022, Washington State enacted what is likely the broadest ban on company use of non-disclosure and non-disparagement (NDA) provisions. The new Washington statute called the “Silence No More” Act, bans NDAs related to all forms of workplace discrimination as well as wage and hour violations and conduct that is “recognized as against a clear mandate of public policy.”
</p>

The Act specifically prohibits agreements containing non-disclosure and non-disparagement provisions that restrict applicants, employees, and independent contractors from openly discussing conduct or a legal settlement involving conduct that the applicant, employee, or contractor “reasonably believed” was illegal discrimination, harassment, retaliation, a wage and hour violation, a sexual assault, or conduct that is “against a clear mandate of public policy. While the Washington law contains these broad restrictions, note that it does not prohibit employers from requiring the amount paid in settlement of any claim to be kept confidential. Essentially, this means that any settlement of a claim can only prohibit discussion of the amount of settlement, not the facts that lead to the settlement. Additionally, employers can still protect trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential information that does not involve illegal conduct. <cite> Carrie Hoffman, <a href="https://www.foley.com/en/insights/publications/2022/07/several-states-broad-ban-nondisclosure-agreements">Several States have Enacted Broad Ban on Non-disclosure Agreements</a> (Foley.com 2022). </cite>

It can be useful for a settlement agreement to state that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed; for a case where that would have been useful, see a 2022 Federal Circuit' decision, where the appeals court, reversing the district court (with one judge dissenting), held that a particular version of a settlement agreement was binding. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16126587345900531645">PlasmaCAM, Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-23-30-3">
<p>
A settlement agreement should preferably contain an explicit agreement that the plaintiff (or would-be plaintiff) won't sue the other party — that way, if the plaintiff <i>does</i> file suit, and the other party gets the case tossed on grounds of settlement, then the other party should be able to recover its attorney fees as damages for the breach of the agreement not to sue.  
</p>

<p>
Why be so specific? Because there's apparently a split among different jurisdictions as to whether such an explicit "covenant not to sue" is required, as explained by Virginia's supreme court in a 2021 decision. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11900052395696748218">Bolton v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-23-30-4">
<p>
When parties enter into an agreement to settle a dispute, it can be advantageous for the agreement's background section to be clear that the parties were not relying on each other's representations; they could use language such as <a href="#r-rel-discl">4.10</a>: <i>Reliance Waiver Option</i> for that purpose. Doing so can help to forestall at least some subsequent fraud claims. <cite> Cf. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13296476413948455536">Pappas v.

<p>
If a country's ambassador signed a commercial loan agreement with a bank, and the agreement contained a choice-of-law and choice-of-forum clause, would that be enough to waive the country's sovereign immunity against judicial enforcement of the agreement? In a D.C. federal-court case, a magistrate judge concluded that the bank had not <i>shown</i> that the ambassador had actual or apparent authority to waive sovereign immunity. <cite> See John F.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-23-32-1">
<p>
When a seller tries to back out of a contract to sell real property (or, sometimes, other property), the buyer might sue for specific performance to compel the seller to sell. Ordinarily, a grant of specific performance would preclude an accompanying award of damages for breach of the contract.
</p>

<p>
BUT: The Texas supreme court announced "a narrow set of circumstances" in which certain damages <span class="underline">are</span> recoverable even when specific performance is also granted:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We hold that, while an award of specific performance usually precludes a monetary award, there is a narrow set of circumstances in which a breach of a contract for the sale of real property may be remedied by specific performance and a monetary award of reasonable, foreseeable expenses directly traceable to the delay in performance and, in cases where the purchaser breaches, incurred in connection with the seller’s care and custody of the property during such delay. <cite> <a href="https://www.txcourts.gov/media/1460718/230868.pdf">White Knight Development, LLC v.

EXAMPLE: Reality-show producers often demand that cast members sign agreements with nondisparagement clauses.

<p>
&#x2013;  In California, <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB2365">Cal. Civ. Code § 1670.8</a> prohibits such disparagement provisions in <i>consumer</i> contracts — with civil penalties for violation. (The limitation to <i>consumer</i> contracts is probably why the <i>Bachelorette</i> disparagement prohibition, cited at <a href="#dispar-ex">24.1.2.1</a>, <i>wasn't</i> held to be unenforceable.)
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Also in California, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=12964.5.&lawCode=GOV">Cal. Gov. Code § 12964.5</a>  provides in part:

</p>

<p>
(a) It is an unlawful employment practice for an employer, in exchange for a raise or bonus, or as a condition of employment or continued employment, to do either of the following: &#x2026; (2)(A) For an employer to require an employee to sign a nondisparagement agreement or other document that purports to deny the employee the right to disclose information about unlawful acts in the workplace, including, but not limited to, sexual harassment.

The Consumer Review Fairness Act makes it illegal for companies to include standardized provisions that threaten or penalize people for posting honest reviews. 
</p>

<p>
For example, in an online transaction, it would be illegal for a company to include a provision in its terms and conditions that prohibits or punishes negative reviews by customers. (The law doesn’t apply to employment contracts or agreements with independent contractors, however.) #+end_quot <cite> Federal Trade Commission, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/consumer-review-fairness-act-what-businesses-need-know">Consumer Review Fairness Act: What Businesses Need To Know</a> (FTC.gov Feb. 2017; extra paragraphing added).

D.&nbsp; The (U.S.) National Labor Relations Board took the position that a lawsuit by an employer to enforce a contractual non-disparagement provision would be partly preempted by the National Labor Relations Act, and that the employer's continued prosecution of the lawsuit after receiving a warning letter from the NLRB would violate the Act. <cite> Nat'l Labor Rel.

<p>
No-<i>hire</i> clauses — as opposed to no-<i>solicitation</i> clauses, see <a href="#r-nonsol-cls">19.6</a> — can pose significant legal dangers; for that reason, we won't consider any transaction rule on that subject. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In January 2025, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/241-0029-planned-building-services-inc">entered into</a> a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Planned-ACCO.pdf">consent-order agreement</a> with building services contractor Planned Building Services and its affiliates ("Planned"); the order directed Planned to stop enforcing no-hire agreements that limited the ability of residential and commercial building owners from hiring Planned's building-service workers.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In December 2024, the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/241-0082-guardian-service-industries-inc-matter">Federal Trade Commission</a> "ordered building services contractor Guardian Service Industries, Inc. (Guardian) to stop enforcing a no-hire agreement that prohibits building owners and managers from hiring Guardian’s employees." Then-commissioner Andrew Ferguson — now the FTC chair — <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/guardian-ferguson-dissenting-statement-final.pdf">dissented</a> on (what I'd call) technical grounds, while agreeing that no-hire clauses <i>could</i> be illegal. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-six-high-tech-companies-stop-entering-anticompetitive-employee">extracted</a> a five-year antitrust consent decree preventing Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, and Pixar from entering into agreements not to solicit each others' employees (with certain exceptions). According to the DOJ, such agreements "eliminated a significant form of competition to attract highly skilled employees, and overall diminished competition to the detriment of affected employees who were likely deprived of competitively important information and access to better job opportunities." 
</p>

<p>
Since then, the Antitrust Division has tried — generally without success, at least so far — to <b>criminally prosecute</b> companies and executives who allegedly engaged in similar behavior. <cite> See Eric Akira Tate and Cooper J. Spinelli, <a href="https://elc.mofo.com/topics/no-poach-case-alert-doj-s-no-poach-strategy-dealt-another-blow-as-court-tosses-case-before-it-reaches-jury">No-Poach Case Alert: DOJ’s No-Poach Strategy Dealt Another Blow As Court Tosses Case Before It Reaches Jury</a> (MoFo.com 2023). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-non-sol-cust-cls">
<p>
Some employment agreements state that if the employee leaves the company, the employee is prohibited from soliciting the (now-former) employer's customers for a stated period of time. At least in some jurisdictions, courts treat such clauses more leniently than they do noncompetition covenants, especially if the prohibition extends only to customers with which the former employee worked directly.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In its 2023 <i>NuVasive</i> decision, the First Circuit affirmed a Boston federal judge's decision to order a former medical-device sales representative to pay his former employer more than $1.7 million, in:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>damages for violating noncompetition and customer-nonsolicitation obligations in his employment agreement; and</li>
<li>attorney fees for spoliation of evidence by failing to preserve text messages. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10022803410102757427">NuVasive, Inc. v. Day</a>, 77 F.4th 23 (1st Cir. 2023). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
In that case, the <i>nonsolicitation</i> obligation included the following language quoted by the district court:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The NuVasive PIIA additionally includes a non-solicitation clause (Section VI) and a non-competition clause (Section VII). 
</p>

<p>
Both clauses include provisions extending the terms of the clauses for one year following the termination of Defendants' engagement with NuVasive.
</p>

<p>
The non-solicitation clause provides that <b>Defendants agree not to</b> "solicit, entice, persuade, induce, call upon or provide services to any of the Customers . . . accounts or clients that [they] worked with, had responsibility or oversight of, provided services related to, or learned significant information about during [their] employment (or other association) with [NuVasive] for any purpose other than for the benefit of [NuVasive]." "Customers" refers to "hospitals (including but not limited to surgery centers and other healthcare institutions and their employees), payers (including but not limited to insurance companies and third party billers), and physicians (or other health care practitioners including but not limited to the employees of any surgeon or other healthcare practitioners) who use, order or approve the use of ordering of [NuVasive] products or services." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4277304198256924670">NuVasive, Inc. v.

E.&nbsp; By its terms, the Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act excludes customer-<i>nonsolicitation</i> agreements from the statute's coverage, along with confidentiality agreements; invention-assignment agreements; garden-leave agreements; and forfeiture agreements that aren't triggered by competition.) <cite> <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXI/Chapter149/Section24l">Mass.

No-shopt clauses are quite common in corporate acquisitions: Once a prospective buyer of a company has spent the time and money to check out a potential acquisition target, the buyer doesn't want the target's management going off and looking for a higher price.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>that a potential <a href="#org7aeab59">Competing Transaction</a> proposed by a third party — if completed — would be more favorable to the Seller's stockholders (or comparable interest owners) than the Transaction; or</li>

<li>that Shopping the Deal is necessary or advisable for the Seller's board to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Comms: The Seller will advise the Buyer in writing, at least 48 hours beforehand, that the Seller intends to invoke the fiduciary-out exception of this section.</li>

<li>For the avoidance of doubt: The Seller is not required to disclose, to the Buyer, the detailed content of the advice from the Seller's legal counsel or other advisers concerning the possibility of a fiduciary out.</li>

<h6 id="org50ad4b5">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org50ad4b5">
<p>
A.&nbsp; In a merger-or-acquisition ("M&A") deal, the Seller will often insist on including a "fiduciary-<i>out</i>" clause in the contract. That's because the Seller's board of directors might have a fiduciary duty to the seller's shareholders, requiring the board to consider, and even accept, better offers than the deal.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; A fiduciary-<i>out</i> clause will typically also allow a Seller not only to shop the deal (if an unsolicited offer comes along) but to terminate an existing acquisition agreement, e.g., if a better offer comes along. EXAMPLE: See sections 5.2 and 7.8 of the 2023 <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93410/000095014223002670/eh230413259_ex0201.htm">Agreement and Plan of Merger</a> under which oil-and-gas giant Chevron agreed to acquire Hess Corporation. <cite> See Richard Presutti, Matthew Gruenberg and Andrew Fadale, <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/10/02/private-equity-buyer-public-target-ma-deal-study-2015-17-review/">Private Equity Buyer/Public Target M&A Deal Study: 2015-17 Review</a> (law.harvard.edu 2018). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The parties' drafter(s) would need to address the termination issue separately in the Con&shy;tract, because the termination prerequisites might well be subject to serious negotiation.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-no-shop-no-termin-fid-out">
<p>
The Con&shy;tract could provide for:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>a "fiduciary out" right for the Seller to terminate the <a href="#org9e58394">Transaction</a> if the Seller were to get a better offer; and/or</li>

<li>a breakup fee, to a specified party in the event of termination;</li>
</ol>

<p>
but this Protocol itself does not provide for either.

<h6 id="org585bd22">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org585bd22">
<p>
A.&nbsp; In merger- and acquisition ("M&A") agreements, breakup-fee provisions are usually closely negotiated; they typically provide for a seller to pay the buyer a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakup-fee.asp">breakup fee</a> if the seller exercises its fiduciary-out option.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: When Microsoft acquired LinkedIn in 2016, LinkedIn was contractually obligated to pay Microsoft a breakup fee of $725 million if LinkedIn terminated the parties' agreement in order to accept a "superior proposal," which was defined at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1271024/000104746916014430/a2229104zdefm14a.htm#cs_h64">page 98</a> of LinkedIn's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (But the deal <i>did</i> go through, with Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn.)

A.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: The Business Relationship between the Obligated Party and the Company could be indirect if, for example: (i) one company (the "target") is acquired by another; and (ii) as part of the deal, the Obligated Party is an executive of the target company who agrees not to compete with the acquiring company for a specified period of time. 
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: The Business Relationship End is defined to make it relatively easy to determine when the Noncompete would expire. Otherwise, the Noncompete might be unenforceable, as happened in Texas's <i>Central States Logistics</i> case discussed at <a href="#noncomp-end-c">24.5.12.12</a>.

<p>
A.&nbsp; The rationale here is to help the Company get the benefit of its bargain in case the Obligated Party defies the noncompetition restrictions. Absent a tolling provision like this, a court might well take the position that a noncompete could no longer be enforced if its term had ended during the course of the litigation. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9116875603963677283">Daneshgari v. Patriot Towing Servs., LLC</a>, 864 S.E.2d 710, 712-13 (Ga. App. 2021) (citing cases). </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Some courts, though, seem to be conservative in applying tolling provisions of this kind. EXAMPLE: In Minnesota's <i>Petitti</i> case, a state appeals court reversed and remanded a temporary injunction, on grounds that the trial court's application of a tolling provision had impermissibly expanded the scope and duration of the underlying noncompetition covenant. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11499094698459774669">Medtronic, Inc. v. Petitti</a>, No. A18-0010, slip op. (Minn. App. Jul. 23, 2018) (unpublished). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; This section isn't limited to extending an injunction, just in case a court or arbitrator awards damages for violation of the Noncompete but doesn't enjoin violation (e.g., by refusing to honor the tolling provision of this section).

<p>
The enforceability of <i>post-employment</i> noncompetition covenants in the United States is changing rapidly, especially when it comes to low-wage workers. <b>Drafters of noncompetition covenants for employees should definitely be (or consult) experienced legal counsel.</b> <cite> See generally, e.g., Michael Wexler, Katherine Perrelli, and Robert Milligan, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/50-state-desktop-reference-what-6952096">50 State Desktop Reference - What Businesses Need to Know about Non-Competes and Trade Secrets Law - 2024</a> (JDSupra.com). </cite>

<p>
Post-employment noncompetes are essentially <b>prohibited in California</b>, as discussed just below. And they're highly restricted in some other states, as discussed at <a href="#noncomp-states-c">24.5.12.6</a>. 
</p>

<p>
(The California-based global law firm Morrison Foerster, affectionately known in legal circles as "MoFo," has <a href="https://www.mofo.com/resources/insights/250319-non-compete-round-up--ftc-nlrb-california-and-delaware">a useful 2025 update on that subject</a>.)

<p>
Famously, a California statute has been interpreted as a per-se rule prohibiting virtually all <i>post-employment</i> noncompetition covenants. <cite> See <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=16600.&lawCode=BPC">Cal.

<p>
(Business-to-business noncompetes, however, are subject to a rule of reason. <cite> See <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=16600.">Ixchel Pharma, LLC v. Biogen, Inc.</a>, 9 Cal. 5th 1130, 1150 (2020) (on certification from Ninth Circuit) (rule of reason). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Exception:</b> In California, a noncompete in a contract for the sale of <b>all</b> of a person's interest in a business (in various "flavors") might be permitted by an statutory exception to the general prohibition. The same could be true in the case of dissolution or dissociation from a partnership. <cite> See Cal.

Relatedly: A California employment agreement purported to require assignment of <i>post-employment</i> inventions.

It sometimes happens that an employee of a non-California company is subject to a noncompete, then quits to join a California competitor of the former employer. In that situation, a 2024 California statute can come into play: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
16600.5. (a) Any contract that is void under this chapter is unenforceable regardless of where and when the contract was signed.
</p>

<p>
(b) An employer or former employer shall not attempt to enforce a contract that is void under this chapter regardless of whether the contract was signed and the employment was maintained outside of California.
</p>

<p>
(c) An employer shall not enter into a contract with an employee or prospective employee that includes a provision that is void under this chapter.
</p>

<p>
(d) An employer that enters into a contract that is void under this chapter or attempts to enforce a contract that is void under this chapter commits a civil violation.
</p>

<p>
(e) (1) An employee, former employee, or prospective employee may bring a private action to enforce this chapter for injunctive relief or the recovery of actual damages, or both. (2) In addition to the remedies described in paragraph (1), a prevailing employee, former employee, or prospective employee in an action based on a violation of this chapter shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. <cite> <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=16600.5.">Cal.

&#x2013;  By statute, <b>Texas</b> allows noncompetes, but only subject to certain prerequisites, for example, the noncompete provision must be ancillary to an otherwise-enforceable contract; it must be reasonable in time, geographic scope, and operating scope; and it must be supported by separate consideration. <cite> See Zach Wolfe, Wolfe on Texas Non-Compete Litigation, or, <a href="https://fiveminutelaw.com/2021/03/15/my-big-fat-texas-non-compete-paper/">My Big Fat Texas Non-Compete Paper</a> (2021).

At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission, under chair Lina Khan, adopted a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/noncompete-rule">Noncompete Rule</a> that essentially banned post-employment noncompetes. In response, several business organizations sued in federal court and obtained a preliminary injunction forbidding enforcement of the rule. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17673419824714059213">Ryan LLC v.

Moreover, in early 2022 the <i>Treasury</i> Department took a hard look at noncompetition agreements and proposed that the Justice Department start to use antitrust law to "disciplin[e] the use and abuse of restrictive employment agreements, including non-compete agreements &#x2026;." <cite> U.S. Dept. of the Treasury, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/State-of-Labor-Market-Competition-2022.pdf">The State of Labor Market Competition</a> 28, 47, 51, 54 (Treasury.gov Mar. 7, 2022); see also U.S. Dept. of Justice, Press Release, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-national-labor-relations-board-announce-partnership-protect-workers">Justice Department and National Labor Relations Board Announce Partnership to Protect Workers</a> (Justice.gov Jul. 26, 2022). </cite>

At this writing, it's not completely clear what position the second-term Trump administration will take on noncompetition covenants. A law firm memo summarizes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Trump administration is seeking to pause the FTC’s pursuit of appeals of two district court decisions that blocked the FTC’s rule banning noncompetes, suggesting an expected shift in the government’s approach to the rule.</li>
<li>Despite the motions to stay, and though the FTC may not pursue any further formal rulemaking on the issue, FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson is continuing to emphasize his view that noncompete agreements potentially harm competition in labor markets. <cite> Tobias E. Schlueter and Zachary V.

Even in those jurisdictions that allow enforcement of post-employment noncompetes, the noncompetition covenants must be "reasonable" in time. 
</p>

<p>
DCT note: My <i>general</i> impression about noncompete periods is that:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For post-<i>employment</i> noncompetition covenants, one year is likely to be a reasonably-safe bet in many jurisdictions;</li>

In a Delaware case, an employment agreement's noncompetition covenant barred employees from competing with the holding company. But the noncompete <i>didn't</i> prohibit employees from competing with their actual former employer, which was a subsidiary of the holding company. So, the former employer was unable to enforce the noncompete against the now-former employees. Vice Chancellor Will remarked: "This case presents a textbook example of why parties should ensure their contracts say what they mean and mean what they say." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12965075467964083915">Frontline Techs.

If it's <i>not</i> easy, that might invalidate the noncompete. EXAMPLE: In a Texas case, a noncompete period was written to run for 24 months "following the Carrier's last contact with any client or client[s] of Broker &#x2026;." A Houston court of appeals ruled that the noncompete was unenforceable because: "&#x2026; there is no means for <i>[the Carrier]</i> to know when it has had its last contact with any client or clients of <i>[the Broker]</i>. Because <i>[the Carrier]</i> cannot determine when the time of the covenant not to compete has ended, it cannot be enforced as written." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11727916470091024683">Central States Logistics, Inc. v.

A Ninth Circuit case illustrates a "circuit split," i.e., a split among different federal appellate courts as to how federal courts should deal with state laws concerning noncompetition and forum selection: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A contract between a <i>New Jersey</i> company and a <i>California</i> employee contained a post-employment noncompetition covenant.</li>

<li>The contract also required any litigation between the company and the employee to take place in <i>New Jersey</i>.</li>

<li>The employee quit the New Jersey company and goes to work for one of the company's competitors.</li>

<li>The competitor-new employer competitor filed a preemptive lawsuit in federal court <i>in California</i> seeking a declaratory judgment that under <i>California</i> law, both the employee's noncompetition covenant <i>and</i> the forum-selection provision are unenforceable.</li>

<li>The (former) employer moved to transfer the lawsuit to New Jersey.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The federal district court in California denied the motion, citing California's ban on such forum-selection provisions; the Ninth Circuit affirmed. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16287025314148461306">DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. v.

In an Alabama case, the state's supreme court affirmed summary judgment that a employee's noncompetition covenant — set forth in a separate, later-signed addendum to the employment agreement — was unenforceable because it was not signed by the employer, whereas <b>a state statute</b> required signature by all parties because of the nature of the noncompetition covenant. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18138889983165234816">Amanda Howard Real Estate, LLC v.

In some jurisdictions, it's different when you're selling a business than when you're "just" an employee agreeing not to compete with your employer after your employment ends. 
</p>

<p>
For example, by statute, California's outright ban on post-<i>employment</i> noncompetes doesn't apply in certain situations:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Any person who <b>sells the goodwill</b> of a business, 
</p>

<p>
or any owner of a business entity selling or otherwise disposing of <b>all</b> of his or her ownership interest in the business entity, 
</p>

<p>
or any owner of a business entity that sells (a) <b>all or substantially all</b> of its operating assets together with the goodwill of the business entity, (b) all or substantially all of the operating assets of a division or a subsidiary of the business entity together with the goodwill of that division or subsidiary, or (c) all of the ownership interest of any subsidiary, 
</p>

<p>
<b>may agree with the buyer</b> to refrain from carrying on a <b>similar business within a specified geographic area</b> in which the business so sold, or that of the business entity, division, or subsidiary has been carried on, 
</p>

<p>
<b>so long as the buyer</b>, or any person deriving title to the goodwill or ownership interest from the buyer, <b>carries on a like business therein</b>.

A California appeals court — rejecting an arbitrator's contrary ruling about the law, as allowed by the arbitration agreement — held that, when a business owner sells only part of the business, the per-se prohibition of § 16600 doesn't apply; the court went on, however, to say that a rule-of-reason analysis is still required. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4042199244724767053">Samuelian v.

This is an area where I've seen references to court holdings, but I haven't yet dug into the law in different jurisdictions. This is another area where lawyers should definitely check the law in the relevant jurisdiction(s), and nonlawyers should definitely get legal advice.

Here are some initial notes:
</p>

<p>
A.&nbsp; <b>Delaware's</b> supreme court held that Cantor Fitzgerald, a global financial services firm, wasn't precluded from enforcing a noncompete provision that called for departing limited partners to forfeit their partnership interests if they chose to compete with Cantor within two years after leaving the firm:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When sophisticated actors avail themselves of the contractual flexibility embodied in the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act—a statute that is expressly designed "to give maximum effect to the principle of freedom of contract and to the enforceability of partnership agreements"—and agree that a departing partner will forfeit a specified benefit should he engage in competition with the partnership, <b>our courts should, absent unconscionability, bad faith, or other extraordinary circumstances, hold them to their agreements</b>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11730991315199702370">Cantor Fitzgerald, LP v. Ainslie</a>, 312 A.3d 674, 677 (Del. 2024) (reversing and remanding chancery-court; cleaned up). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The state supreme court later advised the Seventh Circuit that its <i>Cantor</i> holding wasn't restricted to the limited-partnership context; the court said that the same "employee choice" doctrine would allow forfeiture of equity grants by a plant manager, formerly employed by an auto-salvage and recycled-parts company, who moved to a competitor. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16366928682617876727">LKQ Corp. v. Rutledge</a>, 337 A.3d 1215 (Del. 2024) (<i>en banc</i>), <i>responding to</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3573803051089692997">96 F.4th 977, 987</a> (7th Cir. 2024); <i>subsequent proceeding</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1648228407054538523">126 F.4th 1247</a> (7th Cir. 2025) (reversing and remanding district court's summary judgment in favor of Rutledge). </cite>
</p>

<p>
To similar effect: After a fire-safety-system company was acquired, one of its longtime employees signed an agreement with the acquiring company in which the employee was granted equity units in the acquiring company. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The agreement included a noncompete — and it also said that the employee's equity grant would automatically be forfeited if the employee breached the noncompete or if he were fired "for cause."</li>

<li>There was no other consideration for the noncompete (e.g., no right to continued employment by the acquiring company).</li>

<li>A couple of years later, the employee indicated his desire to leave the acquiring company; negotiations for his exit were unproductive, and the employee began planning to leave and start a competing company.</li>

<li>Learning about the employee's plans, the company fired him, purportedly for cause, and sued him for violating the noncompete.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In Round 1 of the litigation, Delaware's chancery court held that the automatic equity forfeiture had dissolved the employee's noncompete obligation for lack of consideration (and implicitly distinguished <i>Cantor</i> on that basis). But the state supreme court reversed, holding that "[b]ecause consideration is measured at the time of contracting and not at the time of enforcement," the equity units granted to the employee were valid consideration, even though they were subject to forfeiture. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=890148040047939495">North American Fire Ultimate Holdings LP v. Doorly</a>, No. 2024-0023-KSJM, slip op. at n.33-34 & accompanying text (Del. Ch.

B.&nbsp; <b>Massachusetts</b> enacted a statute that subjects forfeiture-<i>for-competition</i> agreements to the same exacting standards as "classic" noncompetes. <cite> See Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act, <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXI/Chapter149/Section24l">Mass.

Relatedly: By its terms, the Massachusetts noncompete statute excludes employee- and customer-<i>nonsolicitation</i> agreements from the statute's coverage, along with confidentiality agreements; invention-assignment agreements; garden-leave agreements; and forfeiture agreements that aren't triggered by competition. <cite> <i>See id.</i> (definition of "noncompetition agreement"); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1117078287982978091">Miele v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-25-1-1">
<p>
People sometimes get all worked up about the fact that a patent <i>describes</i> X or Y or Z that can be found in prior art. 
</p>

<p>
What matters for infringement purposes, however, is not so much what the patent <i>describes</i>, as what it <i>claims</i>. The exact wording of the patent claims will be crucial.

<div id="outline-container-org1610d94" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1610d94"><span class="section-number-4">25.1.2.</span> Each claim in a patent is a separate infringement checklist</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-25-1-2">
<p>
You can also think of each individual claim in a patent as being a separate infringement checklist: At trial, the patent owner’s lawyers and expert witness(es) will methodically talk the jury through that claim (and probably others as well), putting on evidence to show that every claim element is present in what the defendant is doing.
</p>

<p>
Here are a couple of canonical hypothetical examples (simplified — they do not address the doctrine of equivalents):
</p>

<div class="alt" id="orgbf314ae">
<p>
<b>Claim 1:</b> A <i>seating structure</i> comprising:
</p>

<p>
(a) a substantially-horizontal seating platform, and
</p>

<p>
(b) <i>at least three</i> legs extending generally downward from the seating platform.
</p>

<p>
* * * 
</p>

<p>
<b>Claim 5:</b> A <i>chair</i> comprising:
</p>

<p>
(a) a substantially-horizontal seating platform; and
</p>

<p>
(b) <i>four</i> legs extending generally downward from the seating platform.
</p>

</div>

<p>
In these examples:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A <i>three</i>-legged stool with a back support would infringe our hypothetical claim 1 above, because all of the checklist elements in that claim are present in the three-legged stool. Importantly, the additional presence of the of the stool's back support is irrelevant.</li>

<li>In contrast, a three-legged stool would <i>not</i> infringe hypothetical claim 5 above, because <i>that</i> claim requires an infringing <i>chair</i> to have <i>four</i> legs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb5e9802" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb5e9802"><span class="section-number-4">25.1.3.</span> Patent-claim <i>interpretation</i> is often a big deal</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-25-1-3">
<p>
Very often, patent owners and accused infringers engage in expensive legal battles over "claim construction," that is, the proper interpretation of different words and phrases in a patent claim. In the examples above, such a battle might break out over whether the term "seating platform" encompasses a camp chair with a soft, foldable cloth seat.
</p>

<p>
As a general rule, a given word or phrase in a claim will be interpreted in light of considerations such as the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the ordinary meaning of the term in the relevant art(s);</li>

<li>any special meaning stated by the inventor in the patent’s written description — the inventor is free to be his- or her own lexicographer;</li>

<li>how the term was used in the back-and-forth correspondence between the inventor and the patent examiner, referred to as the ‘prosecution history’ of the patent application;</li>

<li>whether a particular meaning is required — other things being equal, a narrower interpretation that will preserve the patentability of the claim will be preferred over a broader interpretation that would result in the claim being invalidated by prior art. (If this issue comes up during the prosecution of the patent application, the patent examiner is supposed to require the applicant to amend the claim to eliminate the ambiguity.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgeab9a16" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgeab9a16"><span class="section-number-4">25.1.4.</span> Only one patent claim need be proved infringed</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-25-1-4">
<p>
As long as the patent owner proves that at least one claim is infringed, and <i>the defendant</i> doesn’t prove that the infringed claim(s) are invalid, then the defendant is liable for infringement.
</p>

<p>
Suppose hypothetically that the example claims above were actually in an unexpired patent, and that they were not proved to be invalid.
</p>

<p>
In that case, anyone who made, used, sold, offered for sale, or imported a three-legged stool would be liable for infringement, even though the stool infringed only claim 5 and not claim 1.
</p>

<p>
Here's an analogy: Imagine that the claims of a patent are like arrows in a quiver, and that a hostile archer (a patent owner) were to shoot several arrows in your direction:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some arrows might clearly be going to miss you; those are analogous to patent claims that you clearly don't infringe. (This assumes a judge and/or jury agrees that these arrows have missed you, which isn't always a given.)</li>

<li>But suppose that some of the arrows in flight appear on their way to hitting you somewhere on your body. It's up to you to try to knock down all of <i>those</i> arrows before they hit you.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-pat-infr-unknown">
<p>
A patent can be infringed by someone who isn't even aware that the patent exists. This is unlike the case for copyright infringement (which requires <i>copying</i> of protectable "expression") and trade-secret misappropriation (which requires having had access to the trade secret).

<h6 id="org270a8dd">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org270a8dd">
<p>
A.&nbsp; <i>Some</i> forms of IP right can arise automatically (in most jurisdictions) without the need for application or registration with government authorities. Examples include copyrights, trademark rights, and trade-secret rights — but <i>not</i> patent rights, which require actual issuance of a patent after a detailed examination of the application by a patent examiner.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; For some of those automatic rights, registration might be required to take advantage of certain legal remedies. For example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A copyright claim in a "United States work" must be registered with the Copyright Office — and the registration must be <i>issued</i>, not just applied for — before the copyright owner can file an infringement lawsuit (although upon registration the copyright owner can recover damages for infringement beginning at the date the registration application was filed). <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411">17 U.S.C. § 411</a>(a); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4728796451311095418">Fourth Estate Public Corp v. Wall-Street.com</a>, LLC, 586 U.S. 296, 139 S. Ct. 881 (2019). </cite></li>

<li>Federal registration of a trademark gives the mark's owner certain presumptions, i.e., that the mark is eligible for legal protection, etc.; those presumptions can greatly simplify (and reduce the cost of) the trademark owner's proving up its case in a trademark-infringement lawsuit. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1115">15 U.S.C. § 115</a>. </cite></li>

<h6 id="org2df2f89">Note</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org2df2f89">
<p>
A.&nbsp; License agreements of various kinds will typically address what's supposed to happen if a third party does things that are supposed to require a license. (The licensee won't want to be making payments to the licensor if third parties are getting away without doing so.)
</p>

<p>
This Protocol spells out a sensible protocol for handling potential infringements by third parties; it's pretty much how such situations are typically handled. Here's a hypothetical example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Alice" licenses "Bob" under Alice's patent.</li>

<li>Under the license agreement, Bob is to pay Alice royalties on Bob's sales of "widgets" that are covered by the claims of Alice's patent. (For this purpose, the <i>claims</i> of Alice's patent are what matter, for reasons discussed beginning at <a href="#nl-infr-warr-scope-pat">25.1</a>.)</li>

<li>A third party, "Carol," makes widgets that compete with Bob's widgets and are also covered by Alice's patent claims.</li>

<li>Unlike Bob, Carol doesn't pay royalties to Alice; that means Carol has lower costs than Bob, giving her a competitive advantage over Bob.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that situation, Bob will understandably want Alice to "do something!" about Carol.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; This Protocol uses the term "Owner" even though a party granting an IP license might not actually <i>own</i> the IP in question. For example, by law <i>an exclusive licensee</i> of a patent or copyright might itself be able to grant licenses.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-r-infr-warr-scope-pat">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A Patent Warranty is a warranty that, so far as the Vendor is aware — but see subdivision 3 below — the Covered Item doesn't infringe any "<b>Patent Right</b>," namely any valid and enforceable claim of a utility patent or design patent that is owned or otherwise assertable by a third party anywhere in the world.</li>

<li>In addition, <b>if</b> <i>the Vendor</i> unambiguously provides the Customer (perhaps indirectly, e.g., via a reseller) with <b>instructions for using</b> a Covered Item (for example, in a user manual), THEN: The Patent Warranty also applies, as stated in subdivision 1, to the <i>use</i> of the Covered Item, by the Customer and/or by other any users unambiguously specified in the Con&shy;tract, in accordance with those instructions.</li>

<li><b>But:</b> The Vendor <b>doesn't</b>  represent or warrant that the Vendor has conducted any particular search or other investigation about any Patent Warranty unless the Vendor clearly states otherwise in writing.</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-nl-infr-warr-scope-pat-scope">
<p>
A.&nbsp; The Patent Warranty is narrower than the Copyright- and Trade-Secret Warranties because a Covered Item could infringe an issued <i>patent</i> — or a <i>future</i> patent — without the Vendor's even knowing that the patent exists. This means that the Vendor can more readily warrant against claims of infringement of third-party copyrights or misappropriation trade secrets than it can against infringement of patents; hence, different scopes for the two warranties.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: For a discussion of the differences between a utility patent and a design patent, see generally the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's discussion of "<a href="https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/essentials">Types of patent</a>." Cf. also the World Industrial Property Organization's discussion of "<a href="https://www.wipo.int/patents/en/topics/utility_models.html">Utility models</a>."
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 2 addresses the possibility that the <i>Customer</i> could infringe a patent claim by <i>using</i> a Covered Item. That's because (U.S.) patent law makes it an infringement to make, <i>use</i>, or sell something that comes within the scope of an issued claim (among other infringements) without the permission of the patent owner. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271">35 U.S.C. § 271(a)</a>, as well as the discussion of patent infringement at <a href="#nl-infr-warr-scope-pat">25.1</a>. ] For example, in the case of Monsanto's post-emergence herbicide Roundup®, the claims of <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3799758A/en">Monsanto's initial patent</a> were directed to "A herbicidal method which comprises contacting a plant with a herbicidally effective amount of a compound of the formula &#x2026;."; that was because the compound itself, N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine ("glyphosate"), was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#Discovery">in the prior art</a>. (Later Monsanto patents were addressed to improvements in the chemistry.)
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Subdivision 3: For its own risk-assessment purposes, the Vendor <b>might</b> want to consider commissioning its own "freedom to operate" patent investigation and an opinion of counsel, to provide the Vendor with at least some comfort on in this regard — because <b>a Covered Item might infringe a patent without the Vendor (or anyone in the industry) even knowing that the patent exists</b>. Such investigations and legal opinions can be costly, but <b>if</b> there's a lot at stake, that cost might be worthwhile. <cite> For additional discussion, see generally, e.g.: &bull;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finnegan.com/en/professionals/linda-j-thayer.html">Linda J.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Concerning the language, "as between the parties," see <a href="#as-between-cmt">34.4</a>. Here, that language recognizes that other factors — such as preexisting contracts — might affect ownership of newly-created IP.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 1 could be overriden with language such as: "<i>[Party name]</i> will own any and all intellectual property that is newly created in the performance of the Con&shy;tract by either party." <i>QUESTION:</i> Should Toolkit Items (<a href="#ip-own-toolkit">25.6.1.4</a>) be excluded from such an override? 
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: <i>Joint</i> creation of intellectual property can occur, for example, in services-type contracts and in collaboration agreements of various kinds, e.g., R&D joint-venture agreements. Who is to own jointly created IP will sometimes be a negotiation point. For additional discussion, see the commentary at § <a href="#ip-jt-own">25.6.1.5</a>. 
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> See the commentary at § <a href="#ip-present-xfr">25.6.1.9</a> for the tale of how Stanford University was surprised to find that it shared joint ownership of an HIV-related patent with a biotechnology company, Roche Molecular Systems, because a Stanford researcher had signed a "visitor NDA" at Roche's predecessor; that NDA gave Roche ownership of whatever the researcher came up with "as a consequence" of his access to Roche.
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Claims of joint creation of IP can be fact-intensive and thus costly to litigate — as illustrated by the <i>Stanford v. Roche</i> case and <i>Omni MedSci</i> cases discussed the commentary at § <a href="#ip-present-xfr">25.6.1.9</a>, and also by <i>BASF Plant Science</i> (Fed. Cir. 2022), where the appeals court reversed a trial-court judgment, following a jury verdict, that the defendant co-owned a particular patent and thus wasn't liable for infringing the patent in suit; the appeals court held that BASF had asserted "an unreasonable view" of what level of contribution by BASF would qualify the company as a joint owner. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6522215961662852722">BASF Plant Science, LP v. Commonwealth Scientific & Indus. Research Org.</a>, 28 F.4th 1247, 1269-71 (Fed. Cir. 2022). </cite>
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; Subdivision 3 is pretty much what the law would say in any case. (This is potentially-significant because a "work made for hire" under copyright law is owned upon creation by the employer, not by the individual, as discussed in more detail at <a href="#ip-own-wmfh">25.6.2.3</a> and <a href="#ip-own-wmfh-k">25.6.2.4</a>.) 
</p>

<p>
G.&nbsp; Even if <i>ownership</i> of newly-created IP is not transferred, a court might find that a contract granted an <i>implied license</i> to the newly-created IP, as discussed at <a href="#ip-own-impl-lic">25.6.2.12</a>.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Under U.S. law, on the <b>patent</b> side: Unless otherwise agreed in writing, each co-inventor of joint invention may use and/or license the invention <i>with no obligation</i> to account to — i.e., share proceeds with, or pay a royalty to — any other co-inventor. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/262">35 U.S.C. § 262</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; On the other hand, on the <b>copyright</b> side: While the co-owners of a joint work may make use of the work as they see fit, <i>they must account to one another</i> from their uses of the work unless they agree otherwise in writing. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: As an illustration of this principle of copyright law, the hit song <i>Let the Good Times Roll</i> was putatively authored by one Leonard Lee; he and his heirs were paid more than $1 million in royalties during the relevant time period. But Lee's childhood friend Shirley Goodman won a lawsuit in which she alleged that she was the co-author of the song — and the court awarded her one-half of those royalties. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7215129246605046094">Goodman v. Lee</a>, 78 F.3d 1007 (5th Cir. 1996). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Another copyright case involved the 1967 hit song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Whiter_Shade_of_Pale">A Whiter Shade of Pale</a> by the British rock group Procol Harum: In 2009, the group's organist, Matthew Fisher, prevailed in the House of Lords (now the UK Supreme Court) on his claim that he should have been listed as a co-author of the song as released, because the Bach-like vamp that he played on the organ during the recording session — instantly recognizable to those of us "of a certain age" — was an addition to the original composition.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The Lords agreed that Fisher had waited too long (38 years) to claim his share of <i>past</i> royalties.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  But the Lords affirmed a judgment below that Fisher was entitled to <i>a 40% share of ownership in the musical copyright</i> in the song, and thus presumably to that share of future royalties. <cite> See <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldjudgmt/jd090730/fisher.pdf">Fisher v.

The issue addressed in this section has been crucial in several important patent cases. EXAMPLE: In 2009, Stanford University found itself being only a joint owner, not the sole owner, of a patent relating to the treatment of HIV / AIDS significant biotech invention by a team of its researchers:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Stanford researcher spent some time at a company, Cetus, later acquired by Roche, to obtain technical training.</li>

<li>The Stanford researcher signed a "visitor NDA" with Cetus.</li>

<li>The visitor NDA contained "hereby assigns" language, under which the researcher made a<em>present</em>assignment of any rights in <i>future</i> inventions that he helped to invent "as a consequence" of his visit to Cetus;</li>

<li>In contrast, the researcher's already-existing agreement with Stanford stated that the researcher <i>would</i> assign his rights in future inventions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Federal Circuit held that the Cetus agreement's "hereby assigns" language took precedence over the Stanford agreement's future-assignment provision — even though Stanford and the researcher had entered into the latter agreement before the researcher entered into the Cetus agreement. That, shall we say, complicated life for Stanford in regard to that particular patent. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6791377855028262739">Bd. of Trs. of the Leland Stanford Junior Univ. v. Roche Molecular Sys., Inc.</a>, 583 F.3d 832 (Fed. Cir. 2009), <i>aff'd as to a tangential issue,</i> 563 U.S. 776, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14519543602869990622">131 S. Ct. 2188</a>, 2194-95 (2011). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Relatedly: A co-inventor's employment agreement required her to assign patent rights <i>in the future</i>, but she never did so for the patent in suit — and her "<i>will</i> assign" agreement was not enough to give her employer the required standing to sue for infringement of the patent. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8486822297588075357">Advanced Video Tech. LLC v. HTC Corp.</a>, 879 F.3d 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (affirming dismissal for lack of standing). </cite>
</p>

<p>
In the same vein but with a different result: A federal appeals court held that the University of Michigan's bylaws did not constitute a "present assignment" of the professor's future invention rights, and so the professor's company (started while he was on unpaid leave) owned the patent and could sue Apple for patent infringement. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3396023843398386325">Omni MedSci, Inc. v. Apple Inc.</a>, 7 F.4th 1148, 1151-52 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (affirming refusal to dismiss patent-infringement suit against Apple for lack of standing on the part of Omni MedSci). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Also relatedly: An administrative judge initially found that the media-device company Roku didn't own an interest in a patent because a co-inventor of the patent, employed by the company, had only <i>promised</i> to assign his patent rights to the company. The International Trade Commission reversed, finding that a different document, signed by the employee, did constitute a <i>present</i> assignment of "expectant rights." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8898917760797801548">Roku, Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ip-own-pat-notes">
<p>
In the United States, the general rules about patent ownership can be summarized as follows: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Inventors initially own the legal rights (if any) to their inventions. <cite> See generally <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/111">35 U.S.C. § 111(a)(1)</a> (inventor may apply for patent), <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/118">§ 118</a> (application may be filed by person to whom inventor has assigned, or is obligated to assign, the invention). </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <i>Joint</i> inventors ("co-inventors") of an invention jointly own the invention. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/262">35 U.S.C. § 262</a>; see also the notes to the joint-ownership provisions, beginning at <a href="#ip-jt-own">25.6.1.5</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Transfers of patent <i>ownership</i> (or exclusive licenses) generally must be in writing. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/261">35 U.S.C. § 261</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  An employee who was "hired to invent" or "set to experimenting" will usually be considered to have an <i>implied</i> obligation to assign the invention rights to the employer. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10457119262085425061">Teets v. Chromalloy Gas Turbine Corp.</a>, 83 F.3d 403, 408-09 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15243085577758257530">Miller v. GTE Corp.</a>, 788 F. Supp. 312 (S.D. Tex. 1991). (Disclosure: In <i>Miller</i>, the present author represented GTE, which later became Verizon). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>But</b> in a Nebraska federal case, a company was found <i>not</i> to have set its former employees to experimenting, and therefore the company didn't own the rights in anew product that the former employees developed at a startup company that they founded. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2239850965616939954">Farmers Edge Inc., v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ip-own-copr-notes">
<p>
In the United States, the general rules about <i>copyright</i> ownership can be summarized as follows: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The "author" of a copyrighted work initially owns the copyright; joint authors likewise co-own their jointly created work. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/201">17 U.S.C. § 201(a)</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  For copyright purposes, an employer is considered the "author" of a copyrighted work if the work is a "work made for hire." <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/201">17 U.S.C. § 201(b)</a> and the detailed discussion beginning at <a href="#ip-own-wmfh">25.6.2.3</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Transfers of copyright <i>ownership</i> (including transfers of the individual exclusive rights that, together, comprise a copyright) must be in writing. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/201">17 U.S.C. § 201(d)</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  But a simple writing for ownership transfer will suffice — as the Ninth Circuit noted: "It doesn't have to be the Magna Charta; a one-line pro forma statement will do." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9695307318571874997">Effects Assoc., Inc. v. Cohen</a>, 908 F.2d 555, 557 (9th Cir. 1990) (affirming summary judgment). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ip-own-wmfh">
<p>
If a copyrighted work is created by an employee who is working within the "scope of employment," then the <i>employer</i> is considered the "author," and thus the (initial) owner, of the work. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101">17 U.S.C. § 101</a> (definition of "work made for hire"). </cite>

<p>
In a unanimous opinion in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3326238332286533012">Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid</a>, Justice Marshall set out a "nonexhaustive" list of traditional factors that are to be considered, under the general common law of agency, in determining whether an individual author is or isn't working within the scope of employment; the list focuses on the extent to which the putative employer has the right to control the means and manner by which the author creates the work; "[n]o one of these factors is determinative." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3326238332286533012">Community for Creative Non-Violence v.

<h5 id="ip-own-wmfh-k"><span class="section-number-5">25.6.2.4.</span> When can a <i>contractor's</i> work be a "work made for hire"?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ip-own-wmfh-k">
<p>
A different situation arises when a party engages <i>a nonemployee</i> to create a copyrightable work: The <i>hiring party</i> can be considered the "author" of the work, <b>but only if both</b> of the following things are true: 
</p>

<p>
A.  the work must be "specially ordered or commissioned" for use in one of the following nine statutory categories:
</p>

<p>
1.  a contribution to a collective work,  <br>
2.  a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work,  <br>
3.  a translation,  <br>
4.  a supplementary work <i>(see below)</i>,  <br>
5.  a compilation, <br>
6.  an instructional text <i>(see below)</i>, <br>
7.  a test,  <br>
8.  answer material for a test, or <br>
9.  an atlas; 
</p>

<p>
<b>AND:</b>
</p>

<p>
B.  the actual author(s) and the commissioning party must agree, in a written agreement — which should be signed <i>before</i> the work is created, as discussed below — that the work will be a work made for hire. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101">17 U.S.C. § 101</a> (definition of "work made for hire"). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The Supreme Court has said that these statutory categories represent a conscious compromise by Congress as to when the rights of <i>non-employee</i> authors can be permanently appropriated in advance by hiring parties, and so: "Strict adherence to the language and structure of the Act is particularly appropriate where, as here, a statute is the result of a series of carefully crafted compromises." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3326238332286533012">Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid</a>, 490 U.S. 730, 749 n.14 (1989). </cite>
</p>

<p>
(Note that rights assigned to a hiring party, as opposed to rights owned from the outset by virtue of hiring party’s “authorship,” can be reclaimed by author or heirs 35 years after assignment, as discussed at <a href="#copr-recapture">25.6.2.7</a>.)
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101">Section 101</a> of the statute further provides that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a “supplementary work,” as used in the above laundry list, is a work prepared for publication as a secondary adjunct to a work by another author for the purpose of introducing, concluding, illustrating, explaining, revising, commenting upon, or assisting in the use of the other work, such as forewords, afterwords, pictorial illustrations, maps, charts, tables, editorial notes, musical arrangements, answer material for tests, bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes; and</li>

<li>an “instructional text” is a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for publication and with the purpose of use in systematic instructional activities.</li>

<h5 id="orge38d8bd"><span class="section-number-5">25.6.2.5.</span> Work-made-for-hire <i>agreements</i> can be a good idea</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-25-6-2-5">
<p>
It's clear from the above discussion that:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  If a copyrightable work is created by an employee working within the scope of his or her employment, then a work-made-for-hire agreement won't be needed — but it's still a very good idea, to help educate all concerned and as a just-in-case provision, especially if "recapture" might someday be a possibility (discussed at <a href="#copr-recapture">25.6.2.7</a>).
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  For <i>non</i>-employee works, a work-made-for-hire <i>agreement</i> is "a must" under U.S. law if the hiring party wants the work to qualify as a work-made-for-hire.  (And if the work doesn't fit into one of the statutory categories listed above, then the work <i>won't</i> be a work made for hire, no matter what the parties' agreement might say.)
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  In case a work doesn't qualify as a work made for hire, language such as that of <a href="#ip-present-xfr">25.6.1.9</a> (present assignment of future rights) can serve as a backstop provision.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-25-6-2-6">
<p>
The Copyright Act doesn't say whether a work-made-for-hire agreement must be signed before the work is created, or whether it can be signed afterwards to confirm a prior agreement; the courts are split on that subject, as summarized in 2019 by the influential Second Circuit in <i>Estate of Kauffmann</i>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=798023103250295862">Estate of Kauffmann v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-copr-recapture">
<p>
Work-for-hire status makes a difference in the long term: In the U.S., if an author transfers or licenses a copyright <i>and the work is not a work made for hire,</i> then (years later) the author or his or her heirs will have a window of time in which they can terminate the transfer or license and, in essence, "recapture" the author's ownership of <i>the U.S. copyright</i>. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/201">17 U.S.C. § 201(b)</a> (ownership of work made for hire); <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#203">17 U.S.C. § 203</a> (termination of copyright transfers and licenses); see also the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/docs/203.html">Copyright Office explanation</a> as well as Margo E.

</p>

<p>
This issue has come up for some famous songwriters, e.g., Paul McCartney, who sought to revoke his transfer of his U.S. song copyrights; his lawsuit reportedly was settled. <cite> See, e.g., Stan Soocher and Scott Graham, <a href="http://www.lawjournalnewsletters.com/sites/lawjournalnewsletters/2017/02/01/paul-mccartneys-suit-over-songs-recapture-rights/">Paul McCartney's Suit over Songs' Recapture Rights</a> (LawJournalsNewsletters.com 2017); Ashley Cullins, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/paul-mccartney-reaches-settlement-sony-atv-beatles-rights-dispute-1018100">Paul McCartney Reaches Settlement With Sony/ATV in Beatles Rights Dispute</a> (HollywoodReporter.com 2017). For other examples of well-known copyrights being recaptured, see Stephen K.

</p>

<p>
Some publishers and studios reportedly demand that when an author signs a deal, the author must agree that, following a termination years later, the company will have a right of first negotiation and/or a right of last refusal. The statute, however, provides that "a further grant, <i>or agreement to make a further grant</i>, of any right covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is made after the effective date of the termination" or after the notice of termination has been sent; it's unclear whether a pre-termination right of first negotiation or last refusal would qualify.  [DCT TO DO: Right of First Refusal, First Negotiation]  See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#203">17 U.S.C. § 203</a>(b)(4).

<h5 id="org38e7085"><span class="section-number-5">25.6.2.8.</span> So: Include "work made for hire" language in creator contracts?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-25-6-2-8">
<p>
As in so many areas of law and business, the answer to the question, <i>should the contract include work-made-for-hire language?,</i> is a firm, definitive "it depends." (That's a joke.)
</p>

<p>
In some situations where intellectual property is to be (or might be) created, the hiring party might want the contract to state that the IP will be a "work made for hire," in part so that the human author won't have the right to recapture the ownership after 35 years have elapsed (as Paul McCartney did), as discussed at <a href="#copr-recapture">25.6.2.7</a>.
</p>

<p>
Reminder: <i>Merely saying that something will be a work made for hire isn't enough to make it so</i>, as discussed above.

<h5 id="ip-own-tm-q"><span class="section-number-5">25.6.2.9.</span> Ownership of trademarks?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ip-own-tm-q">
<p>
If a party is assigning IP rights in a technology, an assignment of <i>trademark</i> rights might <i>or might not be</i> part of the deal as contemplated by the parties. That's because the assigning party likely won't want to give up control of its "brand" — especially when a service provider will continue in business.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org918d091" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org918d091"><span class="section-number-5">25.6.2.10.</span> Shouldn't a services customer <i>always</i> own newly-created IP? (No.)</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-25-6-2-10">
<p>
A.&nbsp; Under some services agreements, the Provider could create new IP. Sometimes the Customer assumes that it (the Customer) will naturally own <b>any</b> IP created "on my dime" — even when some of the new IP (which we assume created by the Provider) is something that the Provider definitely wants to reuse for other customers, and the Customer has no particular use for it.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; But under U.S. law, the Customer <b>won't</b> always own whatever the Provider creates on the Customer's dime: With limited exceptions:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>an author or inventor owns the intellectual-property rights in his- or her creations;</li>

<li>likewise as between the Provider and its Customer, the <i>Provider</i> — not the Customer — owns the work product of the Provider's employees (typically because of invention-assignment agreements between the Provider and the employees, but often as a matter of law).</li>
</ol>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Normally, if the Provider's employees create copyrighted works or other intellectual property in the course of their work (for example, a website or a software package), the <i>Provider</i> will typically want to own the intellectual-property rights — in large part so that the Provider can reuse its work for future customers.
</p>

<p>
In general, this Provider-favoring practice is economically desirable because:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Provider's <i>current</i> Customer D gets the benefit of the "toolkit" work that the Provider did for <i>past</i> Customers A, B, and C. This lowers the Provider's internal costs for doing its work for current Customer D, which in turn enables the Provider to offer a lower price to Customer D.</li>

<li>In return, Customer D "pays it forward" by accepting that the Provider will own its toolkit work product and thus will later have the right to reuse the toolkit (except for Customer D's confidential information) for <i>future</i> Customers E, F, G, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>
D.&nbsp; To be sure: In some circumstances it might make more sense for the Customer to own the resulting IP. For example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the Customer might engage a software developer to design and build a new software package that <i>the Customer</i> wants to use in its business;</li>

<li>and so, quite understandably, <i>the Customer</i> wants to own the copyright and other IP rights in the new software; that way:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the Customer can seek a competitive advantage over others in the Customer's line of business; and</li>

<li>the Customer can hire other providers to continue development of the new software, without being stuck with the (first) Provider (which might go out of business, etc.).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="ip-own-software"><span class="section-number-5">25.6.2.11.</span> Special case: Ownership of "custom" computer software</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ip-own-software">
<p>
The situation: A customer hires a software developer <i>as an independent contractor</i> to create custom software for the customer's business. The relationship eventually breaks down. QUESTION: Who owns the copyright in the software: The developer, or the customer? 
</p>

<p>
If the contract says <i>only</i> that the software is to be a "work made for hire" <i>but</i> the software doesn't fit into one of the nine statutory categories listed above (see <a href="#ip-own-wmfh-k">25.6.2.4</a>), then the parties can settle in for some expensive litigation. See, e.g., the cases summarized at <a href="#ip-own-impl-lic">25.6.2.12</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the present author's experience, a reasonable compromise is the following, which is reflected in this Protocol:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The customer owns any newly-created IP <i>that's unique to the customer's business</i> <i>or</i> that involves the customer's confidential information;
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The software developer owns all other IP created by the developer, so that the developer is free to reuse that IP in working for other customers. 
</p>

<p>
Why this compromise? Because when a software developer, graphic artist, or other creator is developing IP for a customer:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The pricing quoted by the IP creator will be determined in part by the IP creator's ability to reuse IP previously created for <i>past</i> customers;</li>

<li>consequently, if the <i>current</i> customer insists on owning <i>any</i> IP that's created on the customer's dime, then the IP creator is likely to insist on revisiting the pricing and other economic terms of the deal.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ip-own-impl-lic">
<p>
A hiring party might not be in a hopeless position simply because the work it paid to have created was not a "work made for hire" nor a joint work and the hiring party cannot obtain an assignment. The hiring party might well be able to assert at least a use right in the created work, and possibly even more than that.

The Ninth Circuit rejected a claim that the producer was therefore a copyright infringer, holding that the movie producer had <i>orally</i> been granted an implied non-exclusive license (and thus the copyright owner's action for nonpayment would have to be for breach of contract, not copyright). The court noted pointedly that the dispute over copyright would not have arisen had the parties reduced their agreement even to a one-line writing. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9695307318571874997">Effects Assoc., Inc. v. Cohen</a>, 908 F.2d 555, 557 (9th Cir. 1990) (affirming summary judgment: copyright had not been orally transferred to alleged infringer, but actual copyright owner had implicitly granted a nonexclusive license to defendant). </cite>

EXAMPLE: <i>Oddo</i> (1984): Two men entered into a partnership to write and publish a book about restoring Ford F-100 pickup trucks; one man was to write and edit the book, while the other was to provide the money and run the business. But the two men had a falling-out, so the business guy had someone else finish the book. The Ninth Circuit held that the author had implicitly given the partnership a license to use the manuscript, “for without a license, [the author's] contribution to the partnership venture would have been of minimal value.” <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16704980320035458611">Oddo v.

EXAMPLE: <i>Yojna</i> (1987): An outside software contractor, at the request of a hospital corporation and its subsidiary, developed a computer program for hospital information management. A federal district court held that the outside contractor was the owner of the software, but the subsidiary had a perpetual, royalty-free license to use and sublicense the program, including the right to unrestricted access to source code for purposes of developing new versions and enhancements. The court also held that the license was an exclusive license within the health-care industry. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16206047573853795409">Yojna, Inc., v.

EXAMPLE: <i>Numbers Licensing</i> (2009): An outside contractor sued a former customer for infringing the copyight in software developed by the contractor; a federal court in Washington state held that the software was <i>not</i> a work made for hire, and therefore its copyright was owned by the contractor — but the customer had an implied license. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15430573885155267090">Numbers Licensing LLC v. bVisual USA Inc</a>., 643 F.

</p>

<p>
<b>But:</b> Some courts have held that <i>employers</i> do <i>not</i> have such rights in works created by their employees. Selected cases:
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A former employee of a company had written a computer program in part on company time and in part on his own time. The Fourth Circuit held that if the employee was the owner of the copyright in the computer program, then the company would have had only a nonexclusive license to use the program, which would be revocable absent consideration. The court disapproved a holding below that the company had a "shop right" in the software; it noted that Congress had expressly declined to import the shop right doctrine from patent law into copyright law. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13472936305627095563">Avtec Systems, Inc. v. Peiffer</a>, 21 F.3d 568, 575 n.16 (4th Cir. 1994), <i>vacating and remanding</i> 805 F. Supp. 1312 (E.D. Va. 1992), <i>on remand</i> 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16946 (E.D. Va. Sept. 12, 1994). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A former employee of a  transit authority, who worked as a schedule writer, had developed scheduling software "in his spare time on the job and at home" but had kept the source code and passwords as secrets from his employer. The employee resigned to take another job and offered the transit authority a use license for an annual fee; his supervisor "fired" him, unsuccessfully demanded that he turn over his source code and passwords, called in the district attorney to have him arrested for "extortion" and "destruction of computer programs," and advised his new employer that the former employee was under investigation for extortion. A state appeals court implicitly held that the transit authority didn't have a license to use the scheduling software. <cite> See Kovar v. Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority, slip op., No. 101761 (Mich. App. Oct. 4, 1989), <i>reprinted in</i> Comp. Industry Lit. Rptr. 10,317 (Oct. 23, 1989). </cite>
</p>

<p>
And: a customer won't always win an implied-license dispute. EXAMPLE: In what appears to have been an early "fintech" case, a financial-services firm used custom-developed software to run its business. The software was developed by an outside contractor, but the firm and the contractor never entered into a written contract. When the parties' relationship ran aground over economic issues, the financial-services firm continued to use and modify the software. The contractor sued, and the firm defended on grounds that it either owned the software or had an implied license to continue using and developing it. On a motion to dismiss, the Southern District rejected the financial-services firm's arguments. The case apparently has no subsequent history, so presumably the parties somehow settled their dispute. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5836343976586387779">Logicom Inclusive, Inc. v. W.P. Stewart & Co</a>., No. 04 Civ. 0604, slip op., part IV.A.3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2004) (denying motion to dismiss). </cite>

A.&nbsp; It's not unheard of for a <i>licensee</i> of intellectual property to be faced with a third party's legal- or business challenge to the licensed IP rights. When that happens, the <i>licensor</i> — referred to here as the "Owner" — will generally want to control the response to the challenge, because the Owner will generally have more "skin in the game." On the other hand, the <i>licensee</i> will generally want the Owner to be responsible for costs of the challenge.
</p>

<p>
Toward that end, the following draws on ideas found in the <a href="https://www.utsystem.edu/documents/docs/general-counsel-documents/2016/trademark-agreements">trademark license agreement form</a> of The University of Texas at Austin, which is discussed in more detail in the introductory commentary to Protocol <a href="#r-tm-license">25.2</a>.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: <i>IP-Triggering Activities</i> could include, for example, the making, using, selling, copying, distributing, importing, publicly performing, or publicly displaying, of one or more things, or creating derivative works based on the one or more things.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 4 reflects the fact that, without more (e.g., exclusivity, technology transfer, etc.), an IP license is nothing more than the Owner's covenant not to sue the Licensee for infringing the Owner's relevant IP rights. <cite> Cf. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15776306002294472187">Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Genetics Institute, Inc.</a>, 52 F.3d 1026, 1031-32 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (affirming dismissal of patent-infringement case; nonexclusive licensee did not have standing to sue). </cite>
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 6: Even with an IP license, the Licensee might be subject to other restrictions, imposed by law or otherwise. Here's a simple example: Imagine (i) that an Owner is a pharmaceutical-research company that owns a patent for a new type of anti-viral medication, and (ii) that a Licensee is a Big-Pharma drug manufacturer. Just because the Owner grants the Licensee a license <i>under the patent</i>, it might well still be illegal for the Licensee to start making or selling the medication without getting, say, FDA approval.

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 3: "In arrears" means that invoices are sent <i>after</i> the <i>end</i> of the period being billed, as opposed to "in advance," when invoices are sent up front.

C.&nbsp; Subdivision 3: A statement of work will often specify the payment schedule. Sometimes, though, parties neglect to include such information; for such cases, this Protocol sets forth some fairly typical gap-filler terms.

</p>

<li>The <i>Vendor</i>, of course, will want to be paid as soon as possible, with the Customer (i) paying some portion of the money up front to cover the Vendor's expenses, so that the Vendor won't have to put its own cash at risk; and (ii) making interim progress payments as milestones are achieved— in part, so that the Vendor can stop work if the Customer doesn't pay (see <a href="#serv-susp-nonpmt">26.1.4</a>).</li>

<li>The <i>Customer</i>, on the other hand, would prefer to hang on to its money until the Vendor has finished its work — and perhaps even longer, to be sure that the Vendor fixes any glitches that arise after completion.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Suspension of work — or, "pencils down!" as the administrator of my former law firm used to say about clients with past-due accounts — is sometimes just about the only leverage that a provider has against a slow-paying customer.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; And if the Vendor's intellectual property ("IP") is being licensed to the Customer, and the Customer fails to pay an amount due, then the Provider might want eventually to be able to "drop the hammer" by suspending the Customer's right to use the IP — and thereby making the Customer an infringer of the Vendor's IP rights, giving rise to the possibility of significantly-greater damages liability than merely not paying. 
</p>

<p>
(See also the related discussion at <a href="#nl-pmt-late-not-infr">9.9.8.15</a>, raising the question whether continued use of a deliverable without paying could constitute IP infringement.)
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Sometimes the service in question might be critical to Customer's operations — in which case Customer might want to <i>prohibit</i> the Vendor from suspending the services without "due process" such as notice and an opportunity to cure; see, e.g., Option <a href="#serv-no-susp">26.18</a> for sample language.

A.&nbsp; Background: Some service projects are priced by multiplying a billing rate by the time spent by the provider's personnel.

<p>
A.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Services contracts sometimes include a warranty by the vendor that, <i>in performing the services</i>, the vendor will not infringe any third party's IP rights. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The vendor might even warrant that <i>the deliverables</i> themselves do not infringe third-party IP rights.</li>

<li>For that matter, under the (U.S.) Uniform Commercial Code, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-312">UCC § 2-312</a>, a "merchant" seller of <i>goods</i> (not services) implicitly warrants <i>the goods'</i> noninfringement. <cite> From <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-312">UCC § 2-312</a>: "(3) Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like &#x2026;." see also the discussion at <a href="#nl-merchant-defn">15.5</a> concerning who is a "merchant." ]</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>But:</b> Such vendor warranties might not protect the <i>customer</i> from third-party infringement claims arising from the customer's <i>use</i> of the deliverables, which is a distinct issue. Example: Under U.S. patent law, <i>use</i> of a patented product or method, without permission of the patent owner, would infringe the patent. <cite> See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271">35 U.S.C. 271</a> (a), (g). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Even under the Uniform Commercial Code, the responsibility for infringement might rest with the customer, not the provider, because <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-312">UCC § 2-312</a> also says: "(3) &#x2026; a buyer who furnishes specifications to the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications."
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; <b>So:</b> In any services contract, both the vendor and the customer should give some thought to whether any third-party intellectual-property licenses or other authorizations might be needed for the customer to be able to <i>use</i> the deliverables. Such "use" authorizations could include, without limitation, patent licenses and regulatory licenses.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; As one hypothetical example, suppose that a service provider is a pharmaceutical laboratory that is licensed to manufacture controlled substances such as opioids. It might be perfectly legal for the lab to whip up a custom batch of an opioid-based medication for a licensed physician — but in many countries the physician would need to be <i>state</i>-licensed to practice medicine and <i>federally</i>-licensed to <i>dispense</i> such medications. <cite> See generally, e.g., Maureen Malone, <a href="https://work.chron.com/obtain-dea-license-physicians-22017.html">How to Obtain a DEA License for Physicians</a> (Chron.com, undated). </cite>

</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Subdivision 2 <i>probably</i> duplicates applicable law, in that indemnification for foreseeable damages (that is, reimbursement) is likely to be just bog-standard damages for breach of contract, specifically for the indemnifying party's failure to obtain the license and/or permit that it agreed to obtain.

<p>
For some services projects, the law might require, for example:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>an occupational license for the provider, e.g., a contractor license; and/or</li>

<li>a permit for specific work itself, a building permit.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ServLicStart">
<p>
Imagine that you're a service provider — and now imagine that for a particular project, you don't have <i>all</i> your required licenses and permits in place, at <i>all</i> times. That could give your customer the legal right to "stiff" you, and even to demand that you repay money you've already been paid.
</p>

<p>
For example:  Under a California statute, a contractor might <b>forfeit</b> its right to be paid if it undertakes work required to be done by a licensed contractor (e.g., certain construction- or remodeling work), but does not itself have the proper license(s) at all times while performing the work. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a California case, a subcontractor had not obtained the required license when it prepared initial shop drawings and did other preliminary work. In the trial court, the subcontractor won a judgment for more than $220,000 in unpaid invoices, but on appeal the subcontractor lost because it hadn't been licensed <i>while doing the preliminary work</i>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5670773954467554815">Great West Contractors, Inc., v.

</p>

<p>
Moreover, under a 'disgorgement' amendment to the California statute, such a contractor might have to <i>repay</i> any payments it did receive for the work.
</p>

<p>
A simil ar Tennessee statute is a bit less draconian: "Any contractor required to be licensed under this part who is in violation of this part or the rules and regulations promulgated by the board shall not be permitted to recover any damages in any court other than actual documented expenses that can be shown by clear and convincing proof." <cite> <a href="https://www.tn.gov/lawsandpolicies/laws-a-c/laws-contractors-and-contracting/general-/62-6-101--short-title-11.html">Tenn.

<p>
The corresponding Georgia statute likewise includes certain exceptions that can allow an unlicensed residential contractor to recover, but in one lawsuit, an appeals court held that the contractor did not qualify for the exceptions. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17788393824418484324">Fleetwood v.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-ServLicPers">
<p>
Service providers should be sure that the proper <i>individual</i>, or the proper <i>organizational party</i>, is both licensed and named in the contract. Getting that wrong could lead a customer to try to stiff the provider. EXAMPLE: In a California case, a construction contract (allegedly) mistakenly listed an <i>unlicensed</i> contractor as the party that would do renovation work on a movie/restaurant. This led the owner to refuse to pay. When the contractor sued for payment, the trial court threw out the lawsuit, on grounds that the wrong party was supposedly licensed. Rescuing the contractor, the court of appeals reversed, holding that "Despite the mistake in the written contract, Rosedale and Movie Grill knew, intended and agreed that, in fact, Panterra GP would act as the general contractor and would perform the work contemplated by the agreement. And, indeed, that is what happened." The parties could have avoided the issue by getting the contract right. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15181863647758602399">Panterra GP, Inc. v. Super.

In a Ninth Circuit case, Rearden LLC, a producer of facial motion-capture software, sued the Walt Disney Company, alleging that one of Disney’s visual effects contractors had made unauthorized copies of Rearden's software during production of Disney’s 2017 live-action film <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>. <b>Relevantly here:</b> 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The jury found Disney vicariously liable for its contractor's copyright infringement, awarding Rearden actual damages of just over $250,000.</li>

<li>The trial court overturned the verdict and granted judgment as a matter of law, on grounds that Rearden had not (in the court's view) introduced sufficient evidence at trial of Disney’s <i>practical</i> ability to stop or limit its contractor's directly-infringing conduct.</li>

<li>The Ninth Circuit reversed on that point, concluding that Rearden had indeed introduced legally sufficient evidence at trial to support the jury's verdict. After affirming the judgment below in all other respects, the appellate court remanded, presumably for entry of judgment on the jury verdict and damage award.  <cite>  See <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/09/11/24-3970.pdf">Rearden, LLC v.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: The phrase, "see to it" takes into account that the Vendor might well be a prime contractor that engages subcontractors to do various phases of the work. (Note that in some such contracts that are customer-biased, the prime contractor might have to get the customer's approval before using subcontractors at all, or before using any particular subcontractor; see [DCT TO DO: LINK].)
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Note that this performance standard is phrased as a <i>covenant</i>, that is, a promise, and not as a <i>representation</i> or <i>warranty</i>, for reasons discussed in the commentary at <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">18.2</a>. 
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 1.b: The "start to finish" language has in mind that when a customer hires a service provider, the customer generally wants the provider to "just handle it."
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Subdivision 1.d's definition of "professional" is adapted from the Supreme Court of Texas's definition of <i>workmanlike</i>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17126687559521918562">Melody Home Mfg.

Co.</a>, 420 S.W.3d 30, 37 (Tex. 2014) (responding to certified question from Fifth Circuit). </cite>
</p>

<p>
E.&nbsp; Relatedly: In some circumstances in some jurisdictions, <i>the law</i> might impose an <i>implied</i> warranty of workmanlike performance (concerning which, see <a href="#serv-impl-warr-perf">18.1.6.3</a>). 
</p>

<p>
F.&nbsp; Subdivision 1.d: Some service providers might balk at using the term <i>professional</i> or even <i>workmanlike</i> performance because they fear the term could be ambiguous. But <i>any</i> standard of performance of services is likely to involve factual determinations in litigation or arbitration, so it's hard to see how one is more- or less favorable than the other.
</p>

<p>
G.&nbsp; Subdivision 1.d: <b>Caution:</b> Some customers want language such as, <i>in accordance with the highest professional industry standards.</i> For a service provider, though, this is arguably the worst of all worlds: Not only is the phrase vague, but the provider might as well hang a "Kick Me!" sign on its own back, because anything less than perfection would be open to cricitism in court — much as can be the case with the term <i>best efforts</i> (concerning which, see the definition at Protocol <a href="#r-best-efforts-defn">13.1</a>).

A.&nbsp; Background: For smaller projects, the parties' statements of work might be, um, sparse; for that reason, this Protocol allows for a statement of work to be fleshed out by extrinsic evidence (a.k.a. "<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/parol_evidence_rule">parol</a>" evidence). The language of this section is modeled closely on <a href="https://newyork.public.law/laws/n.y._uniform_commercial_code_law_section_2-202">section 2-202</a> of the Uniform Commercial Code.

<p>
C.&nbsp; The Vendor's responsibility for verifying the initial conditions "on the ground" would mean that the Vendor likely wouldn't be paid for unexpected extra work, EXAMPLE: An excavation company didn't visit a site, where it was to dig a foundation and remove dirt, <i>even though the contract included a representation by the excavation company that it had done so</i>. The excavation company ended up having to remove far more dirt than it had anticipated — and it failed in its attempt to recover its extra costs. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5901793995119577989">D2 Excavating, Inc. v. Thompson Thrift Constr., Inc.</a>, 973 F.3d 430 (5th Cir 2020): See also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8750961917638670738">Nova Group/Tutor-Saliba v. United States</a>, 87 F.4th 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (affirming rejection of contractor's claim for additional compensation for alleged differing site conditions; contract documents had disclosed to contractor that unpredictable conditions and possible obstructions would be encountered). </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Relatedly: It's not uncommon for the need for <i>extra</i> work to be discovered late. A contractor might believe that its customer had orally agreed to pay for late-arising extra work. But that doesn't mean a trial court would be convinced that the oral promise actually happened. And in the U.S. court system, it'd be very difficult to convince an appellate court to overrule a trial-court finding on that point (to say nothing of a jury verdict) if the finding wasn't an <i>unreasonable</i> view of the evidence. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/north-dakota/supreme-court/2023/20230217.html">Shift Services, LLC, v. Ames Savage Water Solutions, LLC</a>, 2023 ND 237, 999 N.W.2d 210, 212-13 (affirming dismissal of breach of contract claim: while contrary evidence might have been provided at trial, record supported trial court's finding that parties did not agree to modify their original agreement). </cite>
</p>

<p>
(Presumably a smart vendor, in <i>pricing</i> the proposed work, would take this "investigation risk" into account.)

<p>
A.&nbsp; This section takes the same general approach as Protocol <a href="#r-amend-defn">2.2</a> (amendments). That approach is especially appropriate for statements of work, which can "evolve" as a project progresses, increasing the importance of leaving a paper trail.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 3: A reality of the business world is that on occasion, parties will agree orally to a change order, but then they never get around to confirming the change in writing.  
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In an Alaska case, "[a] contractor hired a subcontractor to undertake part of the construction of a remote bridge. The initial scope of the contracted work soon changed. <b>Neither the contractor nor the subcontractor kept detailed records of the changes and their associated costs.</b> Years after the project was completed, the subcontractor sued for damages, claiming that it had not been paid for the work it completed." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15592114380779502137">Johnson v. Albin Carlson & Co.</a>, No. S-18615, slip op. at 2 (Alaska Jun. 13, 2025) (affirming district court judgment in part, reversing and remanding in part) (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
What's relevant here isn't whether the subcontractor got paid, but the fact that the parties had to litigate the case all the way to the state supreme court — which sent the case back to the trial court for further (doubtless-costly) proceedings.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 3: By providing a specific protocol for such oral change orders, this section seeks to "write around" court rulings that agreed writing requirements for change orders can be <b>orally</b> waived. EXAMPLE: An electrical subcontractor successfully sued a prime contractor for payment for extra work without a written change order — even though the subcontract seemed emphatically to rule out payment in the absence of such a written change order. The trial court held, and the appellate court agreed, that the prime contractor effectively <b>waived</b> the change-order requirements by virtue of the interactions between the project manager — who had "apparent authority" — and the subcontractor. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11831292908292708175">Patriot Constr., LLC v. VK Elec. Servs., LLC</a>, 257 Md. App. 245, 290 A.3d 1108, 1117 (2023) (affirming award to subcontractor); cf. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10968042369967731976">Menard, Inc. v. DiPaolo Industr. Develop't, LLC</a>, 2023-Ohio-1188, ¶ 15 (Ohio App. Apr. 10, 2023) (reversing summary judgment in part; genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether writing requirement for change orders had been waived). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: To like effect, see a Washington-state case in which the court mostly affirmed judgment on a jury verdict that the builder of a 41-story condominium tower was entitled to some $30 million in additional payments (including attorney fees) because the owner had waived the strict change-order procedures in the construction contract. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12557574107176707768">Skanska USA Bldg. Inc. v. 1200 Howell St., LLC</a>, No. 58950-8-II, slip op. at 35 (Wash. App. Jan. 22, 2025) (unpublished, affirming judgment on jury verdict in pertinent part). </cite>
</p>

<p>
D.&nbsp; Subdivision 2: <b>Not</b> sending a written message, confirming an oral change order, doubtless hurt the case of a subcontractor that unsuccessfully sought (among other things) $40,000 for additional "glazed tile work," because the trial court found that the subcontractor's sole testifying witness wasn't credible in view of the witness's mistakes and inconsistency with documentation. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8527410194355317969">Citi Bldg.

Some services agreements require the service provider to ensure that the agreed work is performed in a "workmanlike manner" or "good and workmanlike manner." To many readers, however, those terms might be unknown or at best only vaguely familiar.

<h5 id="wkmn-sj"><span class="section-number-5">26.8.2.4.</span> Would <i>summary</i> judgment be available?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-wkmn-sj">
<p>
Any given dispute about whether work was performed to a workmanlike standard might require costly proceedings — for example, expert testimony, with written expert reports and perhaps depositions — about some or all of the following issues:
</p>

<p>
&bull;  <i>What</i> is the relevant trade or occupation? 
</p>

<p>
&bull;  What constitutes "successful" practice of that trade or occupation?
</p>

<p>
&bull;  Just how much knowledge, training, or experience is required for successful practice?
</p>

<p>
&bull;  What kind of work regarded as "proficient" by people who have those qualifications? <cite> See generally <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702">Fed. R. Evid. 702</a> (opinion testimony from expert witnesses). </cite>
</p>

<p>
This means that if the parties' respective experts had not-unreasonable disagreements about any of the above questions — highly likely — then a <i>summary</i> judgment, based on <i>undisputed</i> material facts, would likely be unavailable, and a trial, possibly to a jury would be necessary. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_56">Fed. R. Civ. P. 56</a> (summary judgment). </cite>

<h5 id="wkmn-metr"><span class="section-number-5">26.8.2.5.</span> Pro tip: Adding specific, <i>measurable</i> metrics can help &#x2013; a lot</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-wkmn-metr">
<p>
So: Contract drafters having an eye to possible future disputes would be well-advised to include a <i>reasonable</i> set of <i>measurable</i> metrics, the accomplishment of which would (ideally) not be subject to dispute. Example: The painting contractor either did, or did not, put down two coats of <a href="https://www.pantone.com/articles/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2021">Pantone 17-5104 Ultimate Gray</a> paint and clean up all spills.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> It's possible to get overly-specific and thus delay negotiation — or worse, to be overly-specific about things that the parties aren't quite sure of just yet and thus might have to spend time changing later.

A.&nbsp; <b>Caution:</b> Sometimes, a services <i>Customer</i> will want the right to terminate a statement of work "at will" or "for convenience."

In one type of services project, the Vendor is a software developer, where the Vendor creates a custom version of the Vendor's own software package for a particular Customer, and the <i>Vendor</i> retains the ownership rights in the custom version. In such a situation, the Vendor might well want to preclude the Customer from allowing third parties to use the software, for economic reasons and/or to preserve the Vendor's trade-secret rights in the software.

<p>
A.&nbsp; Subdivision 1: The prefatory "importance" language is included to educate and persuade future readers — such as party executives and, possibly, judges and jurors — about the Customer's concern. Such language can be very helpful for that situation, as noted in the Tenth Circuit's 2016 <i>SOLIDFX v. Jeppesen Sanderson Inc.</i> case discussed at <a href="#lim-liab-matl">23.17.5</a>.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Sean Hogle <a href="https://www.redline.net/queries/checklist-must-have-provisions-getting-paid">suggests</a> that if a customer insists on including a continuation-of-services provision along these lines, the vendor should try to include time limits "so that the vendor is not stuck indefinitely providing goods or services for free."
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; EXAMPLE: In November 2025, financial giant Fidelity Investments sued Broadcom — the parties later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/fidelity-settles-lawsuit-over-access-business-critical-broadcom-software-2026-01-23/">settled the case</a> — for "threatening to cut ​off <i>[Fidelity's]</i> access to <i>[Broadcom]</i> software that had become central to ‌the financial firm's systems, creating a risk of outages and trading disruptions."

A.&nbsp; Customers' service-agreement forms often include language giving the Customer the right to demand that the service provider kick someone off a project.
</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Subdivision 2 &#x2013; <b>caution:</b> It's not unheard-of for a bad-actor Customer representative to demand that a Vendor-employee be kicked off a project, for example — &bull; because the Customer representative was biased against people of the Vendor-employee's race, ethnicity, etc.; or &bull; to retaliate against the Vendor-employee for rebuffing sexual advances.
</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Subdivision 4: Whether "good cause" exists is sometimes disputed. <cite> EXAMPLE: A contractor's repeated safety violations led the customer to ask that the contractor's site manager be replaced. The contractor did replace its site manager, but the customer eventually terminated the contract because of the safety problems and successfully sued the contractor for damages. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11478440640996054979">James Constr.

<h4 id="ack-why"><span class="section-number-4">28.1.1.</span> Why include acknowledgements in a contract?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-ack-why">
<p>
Having a party "acknowledge" one or more things in a contract can save time and money by pre-establishing agreed facts for future litigation. This can help parties save the time and cost that might otherwise be needed to "prove up" those facts, because in the U.S., an "acknowledgement" in the body of a contract is much like an admission in litigation. <b>But:</b> A party might be stuck with its acknowledgements — to its detriment &#x2026;.

(Not quite the same: "Notarizing" a document, discussed at <a href="#notary-top">4.8</a>.)

<h4 id="r-ack-defn-pat"><span class="section-number-4">28.1.2.</span> You could be stuck with an acknowledgement</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-r-ack-defn-pat">
<p>
If your client acknowledges something in a contract, it could lock the client into a position that the client might later want to modify or even disavow based on updated information. That's because an acknowledgement in a contract is much like an admission in a lawsuit — and in U.S. federal cases, the trial judge has discretion to allow a party to back away from a previous admission, under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_36#rule_36_b">Rule 36(b)</a> of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A German company, Peiker Acustic, developed and sold technology for hands-free cell phone use. Peiker signed a contract with Cellport Systems to be licensed under certain Cellport patents. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the license agreement, Peiker "acknowledged" that two particular Peiker products came within the scope of the patent claims. (That's the point of saying that an acknowledgement could be of a statement of <i>law</i>.)</li>

<li>Later, though, Peiker changed its mind and tried to back away from that acknowledgement, claiming that those products weren't covered by the patent after all, and thus that Peiker shouldn't have to pay royalties for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Peiker won in the trial court, which said that the acknowledgement in the license agreement was merely a "rebuttable presumption." 
</p>

<p>
On appeal, though, the Tenth Circuit reversed and remanded as to that part of the case, holding that Peiker did indeed have to pay royalties on those products. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3387154681227577319">Cellport Sys., Inc. v. Peiker Acustic GmbH & Co., KG</a>, 762 F.3d 1016, 1022-23 (10th Cir. 2014) (reversing and remanding trial-court judgment in part). </cite>

<h4 id="AckAgrK"><span class="section-number-4">28.1.3.</span> Caution: An "acknowledgement" <i>might</i> create binding <i>obligations</i></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-AckAgrK">
<p>
"Acknowledging" terms and conditions in a contract might be interpreted as <i>assenting to</i> and agreeing to be bound by those terms and conditions. This would likely be the case, though only if the acknowledgement was reasonably clear about the binding effect. <b>Pro tip:</b> Drafters, in this situation (as in so many others), it's often better to err on the side of in-your-face explicitness.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: An employee was held to have agreed that his employer would own certain intellectual property that the employee created, because the employee had clicked on an "acknowledge" button for the employer's invention-assignment agreement. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13441699439384457717">Apprio, Inc. v. Zaccari</a>, 104 F.4th 897, 907 (D.C. Cir. 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> A state supreme court held that <i>what an employee had acknowledged</i> (i.e., a directive to read a new policy) hadn't modified the employee's pre-existing employment contract — consequently, arbitration wasn't required. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10536068526708323376">Lampo v. Amedisys Holding, LLC</a>, 445 S.C. 305, 914 S.E.2d 139 (2025) (reversing and remanding court of appeals decision). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A client of a Royal Bank of Canada investment-banking unit signed the bank's standard customer agreement.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The customer agreement included a first-person statement in which the client said, "I agree that all transactions with respect to any such Account shall be subject to the following terms."</li>

<li>Among those "following terms" was that the customer's transactions with the bank would be "subject to" external rules, including FINRA rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Citing numerous cases, the Eighth Circuit held that such "I agree" and "subject to" language was an <i>acknowledgement</i> that put the client on notice of how transactions would be handled — even though that language <i>didn't</i> constitute a contractual <i>commitment</i> by the bank to handle transactions in that way. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10516055426409894029">Luis v. RBC Capital Markets, LLC</a>, 984 F.3d 575, 580 (8th Cir. 2020) (citing numerous cases), <i>affirming</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18109488917499003841">401 F.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Supplier's electronic acceptance, <b>acknowledgement</b> of this Purchase Order, or commencement of performance <b>constitutes Supplier's acceptance of these terms and conditions</b>. <i>(Bold-faced emphasis added.)</i> <cite> Archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/SD47-YCHU">https://perma.cc/SD47-YCHU</a>, discussed briefly at <a href="#fill-po">15.9.12.4</a>. </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
So: Suppose that a supplier receives one of those Cisco POs, and a supplier representative responds by email, "got it, thanks." According to Cisco's T&Cs, the supplier might have legally agreed to all of Cisco's terms.

<p>
As discussed at <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">18.2</a> (and illustrated in the "Hill of Proof" diagram at <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>): Suppose that <i>B</i> wants to claim that, by signing a contract with a particular statement in it — let's call it the "Statement" — <i>A</i> had made a false representation. Technically, for <i>B</i> to meet its burden of proof, it must show:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>that <i>B</i> had in fact <i>relied</i> on the Statement;</li>

<p>
As a practical matter, if the contract  stated that <i>A</i> acknowledged the <i>Statement</i> — e.g., the statement about patent coverage in the <i>Cellport</i> contract above — then <i>B</i> would likely have a much-easier time making all of these  showings.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-ack-jerk">
<p>
Some inexperienced drafters include statements in which another party "acknowledges" a supposed fact that would be against that party's interest, big time. Here's an overreaching example of a kind that's sometimes seen in confidentiality agreements ("NDAs"), along with a possible edit: 
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org28fcc6f">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>   Recipient acknowledges that Discloser <b>would be</b> irreparably harmed by a breach or threatened breach of Recipient's confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>   Recipient acknowledges that Discloser <b>could be</b> irreparably harmed by a breach or threatened breach of Recipient's confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.
</p>

</div>
<p>
(Emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
Note the change from "would" to "could be irreparably harmed." If you're the Discloser-drafter here, your hope is (presumably) that the Recipient would overlook the "would be irreparably harmed" language. That'd amount to the Recipient's unthinkingly waiving the Discloser's burden of proof in seeking a preliminary injunction or comparable relief (see <a href="#r-eq-rlf-cls">23.10</a>).
</p>

<p>
<b>That, though, would likely slow up getting to signature</b>: Diligent Recipient counsel, confronted with this kind of language, would probably do one or more of the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>be at least mildly irritated at Discloser's counsel for the obnoxious drafting; and</li>
<li>change "<i>would</i> be &#x2026;" to "<i>could</i> be irreparably harmed" as shown above; or</li>
<li>delete the equitable-relief acknowledgement entirely — this would be an example of Discloser's drafter having (unwisely) "poked the bear," see <a href="#poke-bear">30.14</a>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-antitr-hor-vert">
<p>
Restraints subject to Section 1  are generally categorized as <i>horizontal</i> or <i>vertical</i>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A horizontal restraint is <i>an agreement among competitors</i> on the way in which they will compete with one another.</li>

<h4 id="nl-antitr-vert-horiz-ct"><span class="section-number-4">28.2.5.</span> How do courts assess the reasonableness of restraints?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-antitr-vert-horiz-ct">
<p>
Courts employ two different standards to determine whether a particular restraint is unreasonable: 
</p>

<p>
1.  The first standard involves a factual inquiry commonly known as the "rule of reason." The rule of reason weighs legitimate justifications for a restraint against any anticompetitive effects. 
</p>

<p>
Nearly every <i>vertical</i> restraint is assessed under the rule of reason.
</p>

<p>
We conduct a fact-specific assessment to distinguish between:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and</li>

<li>restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer's best interest.</li>
</ul>

<p>
2.  The second standard is the <i>per se</i> standard, which recognizes that a small group of restraints are unreasonable per se because they always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output. Such agreements or practices are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Typically only horizontal restraints qualify as unreasonable <i>per se</i>.</b>
</p>

<p>
However, <b>not all horizontal restraints are analyzed pursuant to the <i>per se</i> standard</b>. 
</p>

<p>
<i>DCT note: In late 2024, a federal district court held that "algorithmic pricing" of apartment rents, facilitated by a provider of revenue-management software, was part of a horizontal conspiracy that was subject to the per-se rule: "The combination and conspiracy allegedly involved (a) a set of vertical agreements between Yardi Systems, Inc., and each individual [apartment-owner] lessor defendant for the use of Yardi's revenue management software, (b) a continuing horizontal agreement between and among the lessor defendants to provide their commercially sensitive information to Yardi, to use Yardi's revenue management software, and to implement the recommendations generated, and (c) a shared understanding that Yardi would use the information provided to recommended rental rates above what would be earned in a competitive market."</i> <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13815703686456729339">Duffy v. Yardi Systems, Inc.</a>, 758 F. Supp. 3d 1283, 1289 (W.D. Wash. 2024) (denying defendants' joint motion to dismiss). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<i>Relatedly: In August 2024, the Department of Justice and the attorneys general of eight states <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-realpage-algorithmic-pricing-scheme-harms-millions-american-renters">filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against RealPage Inc.</a> alleging similar conduct.</i>
</p>

<p>
The notion of a "rule of reason" is the opposite of a "per-se rule" or "bright-line rule," and means that the outcome might be affected by differences in facts (or in online parlance: YMMV, Your Mileage May Vary). See generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_reason">Rule of reason</a> (Wikipedia.org).
</p>

<p>
In a 2024 paper, professors Mark Lemley, of Stanford Law,) and Michael Carrier, of Rutgers Law, argue in effect that the rule of reason might be just window dressing (my words):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Given that the rule of reason is often said to be at the center of antitrust law, and that balancing is at the heart of the rule of reason, it is quite surprising to discover that courts almost never do any actual balancing of harms and benefits. Indeed, balancing has become so rare that in the Supreme Court’s two most recent articulations of the rule of reason test, it omitted the actual balancing of anticompetitive harms and procompetitive benefits altogether! <cite> Mark A. Lemley and Michael A. Carrier, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4896529">Rule or Reason?

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-antitr-hor-ancil">
<p>
Under the "ancillary restraints" doctrine, a horizontal agreement is exempt from the <i>per se</i> rule, and analyzed under the rule-of-reason, if it meets two requirements. 
</p>

<p>
These requirements are that the restraint must be (1) subordinate and collateral to a separate, legitimate transaction, and (2) reasonably necessary to achieving that transaction's pro-competitive purpose. 
</p>

<p>
"Naked restraints" are categorically <i>not</i> "ancillary restraints." Thus, <b>naked horizontal restraints are always analyzed under the <i>per se</i> standard</b>. 
</p>

<p>
A restraint is naked if it has no purpose except stifling of competition. 
</p>

<p>
Some examples of these restraints include <b>agreements among actual or potential competitors to fix prices or divide markets</b>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-Collusion">
<p>
Sometimes it might seem tempting to agree with a competitor to divvy up customers, or to keep your prices at an agreed level, or to take turns submitting the winning bid in response to customers' requests for proposal ("RFPs"). 
</p>

<p>
Those activities, though, can lead to indictment and prosecution by federal- or state authorities for violation of the antitrust laws.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The German airline Lufthansa and the British airline Virgin Atlantic blew the whistle on a price-fixing scheme by a total of 21 non-U.S. airlines, including British Airways, Qantas, and Korean Air. The U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted, resulting in
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a total of some $1.7 billion in fines; and</li>

</ul>

<p>
Authorities might go for low-hanging fruit: Instead of trying to prove up an antitrust violation (a complex task), they might bring charges of <b>obstruction</b> of justice, akin to prosecuting Al Capone for tax evasion. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A British executive, after being extradited to the U.S., was sentenced to 18 months in prison and a $25,000 fine for <i>conspiring to obstruct</i> a price-fixing investigation (<a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/December/10-at-1426.html">link</a>).

</p>

<p>
Not every agreement to restrain trade violates the antitrust laws. Because some cases are more obvious than others, the law has evolved to use <b>different tests</b> depending on the closeness of the question. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At one end of the spectrum are arrangements that can be condemned as illegal <i>per se</i>, or—as in the case of horizontal agreements—at least so likely to be unlawful that just a "<b>quick look</b>" is enough to recognize that <b>anticompetitive effects may be presumed</b>.</li>

<li>At the other end of the spectrum are arrangements that are <b>plainly lawful</b>.</li>

<li>And <b>in between lie the vast majority, where careful scrutiny is necessary</b> to decide.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this category—which includes <b>purely vertical agreements</b>, as well as <b>hybrid agreements</b> — the "quick-look" approach is inapt, and <b>the plaintiff has the initial burden of showing anticompetitive effect under the "rule of reason."</b>
</p>

<p>
The central—and dispositive—question in this case is which framework applies. 
</p>

<p>
Appellant Winn-Dixie Stores brought suit against Appellees—the Eastern Mushroom Marketing Cooperative, Inc. (EMMC), its individual mushroom farmer members, and certain downstream distributors—claiming their price-fixing agreement violated § 1 of the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1. 
</p>

<p>
The District Court instructed the jury to apply the "rule-of-reason" test, and <b>the jury returned a verdict in Appellees' favor</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Winn-Dixie contends this was error, and had the judge applied the "quick-look" approach and instructed the jury to simply presume anticompetitive effects, it would have found Appellees' agreement to be an unlawful restraint of trade. As plaintiff, Winn-Dixie understandably would have preferred the lower burden of proof. 
</p>

<p>
But because <b>this hybrid scheme involved myriad organizational structures with varying degrees of vertical integration</b>, the Court was right to apply the rule of reason. 
</p>

<p>
And because, under that more searching inquiry, <b>the evidence at trial was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict</b>, we will affirm the judgment in favor of Appellees.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-auto-stay">
<p>
Consider the situation where <i>A</i> wants to terminate its contract with <i>B</i>. Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/365">section 365(e)(1)</a> of the (U.S.) Bankruptcy Code of 1978, if <i>B</i> files a petition for protection under the bankruptcy laws — or if <i>B</i>'s <i>creditors</i> file an "involuntary" petition against <i>B</i> — then that filing creates an "automatic stay," prohibiting A from taking any of several forms of contract termination (as well as various other actions).
</p>

<p>
The rationale here is that termination of a contract could jeopardize the orderly reorganization or liquidation of B's business. In the bankruptcy proceeding, <i>B</i> is referred to as the "debtor," and B's business and assets are referred to as "the estate" of the debtor.
</p>

<p>
(The basics of this subject are usefully explained in Robert L. Eisenbach III, <a href="http://bankruptcy.cooley.com/2007/09/articles/business-bankruptcy-issues/are-termination-on-bankruptcy-contract-clauses-enforceable/">Are "Termination On Bankruptcy" Contract Clauses Enforceable?</a> (Cooley.com 2007), <a href="https://perma.cc/PV6N-VFTC">https://perma.cc/PV6N-VFTC</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Even though such termination-<i>for</i>-bankruptcy provisions are unenforceable in the U.S., lawyers keep including them in contracts anyway. The usual rationale is that U.S. bankruptcy law might not apply (e.g., in a non-U.S. transaction), and who knows, Congress might repeal that part of the Code (unlikely).
</p>

<p>
As an "in the wild" example of such a provision, see a Honeywell purchase-order form at <a href="http://perma.cc/CUV6-NKTY">http://perma.cc/CUV6-NKTY</a>, which states as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The solvent party <i>[sic]</i> may terminate this Purchase Order upon written notice if the other party becomes insolvent or if any petition is filed or proceedings commenced by or against that party relating to bankruptcy, receivership, reorganization, or assignment for the benefit of creditors.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> Don't say that "the <i>solvent</i> party may terminate," as in the Honeywell example just above, because if the terminating party is <i>also</i> insolvent, then a court might hold that the party wasn't entitled to terminate — and so the termination was itself an "own goal" breach of the contract — as discussed in more detail in the commentary at § <a href="#termin-rt">20.6.1.1</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-GuarPrefPmtRef">
<p>
Here's a not-uncommon situation, especially during economic downturns:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A customer places an order with a supplier.</li>
<li>In due course, the customer pays the supplier's invoice in due course.</li>
<li><b>But:</b> Within the next 90 days, the customer files for protection under the bankruptcy laws.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that situation, the supplier might be compelled by law to refund Customer's invoice payment; this is referred to as an "avoidable preference." <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3438768229025420150">Coles v. Glaser</a>, 2 Cal. App. 5th 384, 389, 205 Cal. Rptr.3d 922 (2016) (with extensive citations). See also, e.g.: Patricia Dzikowski, <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/bankruptcy-trustee-preference-claims-prior-transfers.html">The Bankruptcy Trustee and Preference Claims</a> (Nolo.com; undated); Kathleen Michon, <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/pre-bankruptcy-payments-creditors-can-the-trustee-get-the-money-back.html">Pre-Bankruptcy Payments to Creditors: Can the Trustee Get the Money Back?</a> (Nolo.com; undated); the guaranty language in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11081049436389993245">Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank, B.A. v. Navarro</a>, 25 N.Y.3d 485, 488, 36 N.E.3d 80, 15 N.Y.S.3d 277 (2015). </cite>
</p>

<p>
To be sure: The supplier would have the right to contest its obligation to refund the customer's payment, for example by showing that the payment was made in the ordinary course of business. But contesting a preference action can be difficult and costly; that's because, under bankruptcy law, the supplier would have to successfully jump through some evidentiary hoops to <i>show</i> that it was entitled to keep the customer's payment.
</p>

<p>
And in any event, as a practical matter many avoidable-preference cases are settled; in the above situation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The customer's "estate" (a bankruptcy term) would likely settle for less than a complete refund of what the customer had paid the supplier.</li>

<li>In return, the supplier would give the customer a <i>partial</i> refund so as to avoid the expense and hassle of jumping through the required proof hoops in bankruptcy court.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That's where the supplier would want to be able to invoke a third party's guaranty of payment: In many guaranties, the guarantor would be on the hook to reimburse the supplier for the supplier's refund to the customer — and probably for the supplier's associated legal expenses as well, if the guaranty said so. (For an example of bankruptcy-reimbursement language along similar lines, see paragraph 7 of a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066134/000119312510000891/dex103.htm">Bank of America guaranty form</a>.)

<h3 id="nl-buy-sell"><span class="section-number-3">28.5.</span> Buy-sell agreements <i>(rough notes)</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-buy-sell">
<p>
A "buy-sell" procedure is related to the ancient "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_choose">divide and choose</a>" procedure, sometimes known as "I cut, <i>you</i> choose," by which children can evenly divide a cookie between them.
</p>

<p>
Something like this procedure is seen in the Book of Genesis, when Abram (later Abraham) and his kinsman Lot agree to separate, and by agreement, Abram allows <i>Lot</i> to choose which part of the Promised Land to claim and settle in. <cite> See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2013&version=NIV">Gen. 13:8-10</a>; see also, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_and_Lot%27s_conflict">Abraham and Lot's conflict</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Buy-sell agreements are often used for breakups of small companies. Suppose that a company  has two owners, "Fred" and "Ginger," who find that they can no longer get along. A buy-sell agreement requires (let's say) <i>Fred</i> to <i>offer</i> to buy out Ginger's share of the company so that she'll be the one to exit the business and leave Fred as the sole owner — but then <i>Ginger</i> gets to decide whether —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to accept Fred's buy-out offer and leave the business; or</li>

<li>instead, to require <i>Fred</i> to sell out to her — on the terms that Fred had proposed to her.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This gives Fred a powerful incentive to offer fair terms to Ginger — because if Fred's terms <i>aren't</i> fair, then Ginger can turn the tables on him and kick <i>him</i> out of the business instead of exiting the business herself.
</p>

<p>
A buy-sell agreement is somewhat akin to baseball arbitration, which likewise encourages parties to make fair offers to settle disputes, as discussed at <a href="#r-escal-ext">2.6</a>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Optional further reading:</i> 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Both buy-sell agreements and last-offer arbitration ("baseball arbitration"; see Protocol <a href="#r-escal-ext">2.6</a>) could be thought of as examples of what the late philosopher John Rawls referred to as "<a href="https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/veil-of-ignorance">the veil of ignorance</a>."</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-28-6-1">
<p>
1.  "Click-wrap agreements": When a user installs software on a computer, or signs up for an online service, very often the user must click on a button or link that says (in effect) "I agree"; the click purportedly signifies that the user — and the user's company — are agreeing to detailed terms and conditions.
</p>

<p>
2.  "Browse-wrap agreements": An online service might also include a purported agreement that the user supposedly agrees to: (i) by continuing to take an action, e.g., continuing to browse a Web site, or (ii) by <i>not</i> taking other action, e.g., by <i>not</i> leaving a Web site.     
</p>

<p>
For convenience, here we'll refer to the terms of either type of agreement as simply "Wrap Terms."

<h4 id="org568813b"><span class="section-number-4">28.6.2.</span> Some case law</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-28-6-2">
<p>
The enforceability of click-wrap and browse-wrap agreements has been often litigated; see generally the posts of law professor Eric Goldman — who knows pretty much what there is to be known on this subject — and his colleagues at his <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2023/08/more-chaos-in-the-law-of-online-contract-formation.htm">Technology & Marketing Law Blog</a>. 
</p>

<p>
For a UK perspective, see the court of appeal's discussion in <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Parker-Grennan-v-Camelot.pdf">Parker-Grennan</a> (UK App. 2024), discussed by <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/digital-speaks-don-t-gamble-on-your-8998020/">Blest & Shaw</a> (2024). 
</p>

<p>
Often, Wrap Terms will be unobjectionable, addressing matters such as not making unreasonable use of an online service, not trying to steal other users' data, and the like. 
</p>

<p>
But sometimes, Wrap Terms will be like a supplier's order confirmation, setting out the supplier's wish list for ground rules — and sometimes a supplier's click-wrap or browse-wrap agreement will contain terms and conditions that affect the parties' negotiated deal.
</p>

<p>
So, in § <a href="#ent-k-click">2.4.5</a> of Protocol <a href="#r-ent-k">2.4</a>, the "are rejected" language is intended to preclude Wrap Terms from becoming part of the Con&shy;tract when they address matters that are covered (explicitly or implicitly) in the Con&shy;tract.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-wu-uber">
<p>
In its <i>Wu v. Uber</i> opinion, New York's highest court blessed the process that Uber used to amend its online terms of service to incorporate an arbitration provision:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
We now turn to the application of these principles to Uber's January 2021 terms of use. Only a few days before plaintiff purportedly agreed to the terms, she received the following email:
</p>

<p>
The headline of the email, "Updated Terms of Use," and the large text immediately beneath it <b>clearly informed plaintiff</b> that she would soon "be asked to review and agree to [Uber's] updated terms [of use]." 
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the email <b>specifically advised</b> plaintiff that the terms would include, among other subjects, "changes to the Arbitration Agreement." 
</p>

<p>
The terms were <b>accessible through several hyperlinks</b>, including a large black button at the very top of the email specifically labeled "Review terms," and the text "Terms of Use" in the first line of the first paragraph, which was <b>distinguished from the black text surrounding it</b> by the signature blue font indicating a hyperlink.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the text of the email <b>expressly advised</b> plaintiff how she could manifest assent to the terms, i.e., by tapping "Confirm" on a pop-up window that would automatically appear when she opened the Uber application on her smartphone. The email was written in plain language.
</p>

<p>
Only a few days later, Uber's January 2021 terms of use were <b>presented</b> to plaintiff by means of a <b>clickwrap process*—a means of acquiring binding assent from consumers that has been *widely upheld</b> by courts across the country. 
</p>

<p>
As previewed in the email, plaintiff was presented with the following pop-up screen when she opened the Uber app on her smartphone:
</p>

<p>
The headline and the larger text in the center of the screen—"We've updated our terms" and "We encourage you to read our updated Terms in full"—*clearly advised* plaintiff that she was being asked to agree to a contract with Uber.
</p>

<p>
The terms themselves were <b>again made accessible</b> by a hyperlink on the words "Terms of Use," which were formatted in <b>large, underlined, blue text</b>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>A reasonably prudent user would have understood</b> from the color, underlining, and placement of that text, immediately beneath the sentence "encourag[ing]" users to "read [the] updated Terms in full," that clicking on the words "Terms of Use" would permit them to review those terms in their entirety. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, Uber provided plaintiff with an <b>unambiguous means of accepting the terms</b> by including a checkbox, "Confirm" button, and bolded text expressly stating that, "By checking the box, I have reviewed and agree to the Terms of Use." It is undisputed that plaintiff checked and box and clicked the "confirm" button. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4811284305254505900">Wu v.

<p>
Contracts often use the terms <i>discretion</i>, <i>sole discretion</i>, <i>unfettered discretion</i>, and <i>reasonable discretion</i>; this Protocol seeks to provide clear meanings for the underlying word <i>discretion</i> — while recognizing that courts might impose their own meanings, as discussed below.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-discr-sole-lim">
<p>
A.&nbsp; A New York appeals court took a jaundiced view of a party's position about a "sole and absolute discretion" clause in an agreement, noting that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
[E]ven where one has an apparently unlimited right under a contract, that right may not be exercised solely for personal gain in such a way as to deprive the other party of the fruits of the contract. Thus, even an explicitly discretionary contract right may not be exercised in bad faith so as to frustrate the other party's right to the benefit under the agreement. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8901689424505951736">Shatz v. Chertok</a>, 180 A.D.3d 609, 610, 117 N.Y.S.3d 239, 2020 NY Slip Op 1383 (N.Y. App. Div.) (affirming denial of motion to dismiss complaint for breach of fiduciary duty; cleaned up, citation omitted, extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
B.&nbsp; In the UK, there is case law indicating that discretion must be exercised in good faith and not arbitrarily, capriciously, or irrationally. <cite> See generally James Brown, <a href="https://www.haynesboone.com/alerts/cathay-pacific-airways-limited-v-lufthansa-technik-ag">Cathay Pacific Airways Limited v. Lufthansa Technik AG - the extent to which contractual rights be limited by considerations of good faith or a duty to act “rationally”?</a> (HaynesBoone.com 2020) <i>discussing</i> <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2020/1789.html">Cathay Pacific Airways Limited v.

</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Analogously: In the context of <i>judicial</i> discretion, in a case <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13800665423501484885">Halo Electronics</a> (U.S. 2016), concerning certain statutory trial-court discretion in patent cases, the Supreme Court noted that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Discretion is not whim. In a system of laws discretion is rarely without limits, even when the statute does not specify any limits upon the district courts' discretion. 
</p>

<p>
A motion to a court's discretion is a motion, not to its inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles. Thus, &#x2026; a district court's discretion should be exercised in light of the considerations underlying the grant of that discretion. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13800665423501484885">Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc.</a>, 136 S. Ct. 1923, 1931-32 (2016) (cleaned up, citations omitted, extra paragraphing added). This concerned a trial court's statutory discretion, in "exceptional" cases, to increase the damages for patent infringement. </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-28-8-3">
<p>
It can be helpful for a contract to explain the factors that can be permissibly taken into account in exercising discretion. EXAMPLE: In a Second Circuit case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An energy supply company was sued for breach of contract for allegedly failing to charge competitive rates for electricity.</li>

<li>The company's agreement form provided for a variable monthly rate that the company would set at its discretion; the agreement "listed several factors guiding that discretion, including 'market-related factors' and [the company's] 'costs, expenses and margins.'"</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the company because the plaintiff "received what was promised under the plain terms of the agreement &#x2026;."

<p>
In a Texas case, a sale-and-purchase letter agreement gave a buyer the "sole discretion" to close a purchase transction (after doing due diligence about the purchase). A state court held that this unfettered walk-away right made the agreement contract illusory and unenforceable, as long as there was no separate consideration for the walk-away right. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7837640098008907112">Maverick Nat.

Contract drafters often say that a party will make <i>[something] efforts</i>:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>when they don't want to take the time to negotiate a specific standard of performance — especially if their clients simply don't know what the standard <i>should</i> be in as-yet undetermined future circumstances, and they don't want to spend the time to try to figure it out;</li>

<li>in the case of <i>commercially reasonable</i> efforts: to emphasize that the term requires what <i>business people</i> would regard as reasonable efforts <b>and</b> - as an alternative to the stronger commitment of <i>best efforts</i> (see Protocol <a href="#r-best-efforts-defn">13.1</a>).</li>

<h4 id="nl-CREUnclear"><span class="section-number-4">28.9.2.</span> Problem: The lack of clarity in the case law</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-CREUnclear">
<p>
In Delaware's 2024 <i>Fortis Advisors</i> case, Vice Chancellor Will noted that "there is no agreement in case law over whether <i>[efforts clauses]</i> create different standards. Delaware courts have viewed variations of efforts clauses—particularly those using the term 'reasonable'—as largely interchangeable." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3585890316977952996">Fortis Advisors LLC v. Johnson & Johnson</a>, No. 2020-0881-LWW, slip op. at text acc'g n.350 (Del. Ch. Sept. 4, 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Likewise, in the 2010 <i>Citri-Lite</i> case, a federal court in California noted that that "[t]here is no settled or universally accepted definition of the term commercially reasonable efforts." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15202977054272395445">Citri-Lite Co. v. Cott Beverages, Inc.</a>, 721 F. Supp. 2d 912, 926 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (denying defendant's motion for summary judgment; cleaned up). After trial, the court elaborated on this observation, with citations; see <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-caed-1_07-cv-01075/pdf/USCOURTS-caed-1_07-cv-01075-15.pdf#page=1.00&gsr=0">findings of fact and conclusions of law after bench trial</a>, slip op. at 45, <i>aff'd</i>, <a href="https://perma.cc/D8DC-J3GN">No. 11-17609</a> (9th Cir. Nov. 21, 2013) (unpublished). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the Southern District of New York — after extensively reviewing case law — remarked that "New York case law interpreting other efforts clauses, including best efforts and reasonable efforts clauses, is anything but a model of clarity." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=598465974293934143">Holland Loader Company, LLC v. FLSMidth A/S</a>, 313 F. Supp. 3d 447, 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (after bench trial, holding that defendant had failed to use commercially-reasonable efforts). </cite>

<p>
It will often be "a factually intense issue" whether a party has <i>complied</i> with an obligation to exert particular efforts — and thus it frequently happens that a court will deny <i>summary</i> judgment, necessitating a costly trial, as happened in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15202977054272395445">Citri-Lite</a>, cited above, and in other cases. <cite> See also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1331132673644442581">MY Imagination, LLC v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-RussellZimmer">
<p>
EXAMPLE: In a 2023 Seventh Circuit decision, the contract in suit provided an example of an extremely-detailed definition of "commercially reasonable efforts"; that definition focused "inward" on the buyer's own practices, as opposed to an "outward" focus on industry standards for what would be done by similarly-situated business. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15881487331300468195">Russell v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-cre-comp">
<p>
Industry standards or other "comparables" might not be helpful: In a 2024 Delaware case, the contract in suit defined "commercially reasonable efforts" as "the exercise of such efforts and commitment of such resources by a company with substantially the same resources and expertise as [the defendant], with due regard to the nature of efforts and cost required for the undertaking at stake." Vice Chancellor Glasscock characterized this definition as "unusual" and remarked that "[a]fter trial, I find this method unworkable; no exemplar companies operate under the actual conditions of Defendants, who, I note, are also different from one another as to their circumstances." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15621251956044928976">Himawan v. Cephalon, Inc.</a>, No. 018-0075, text acc. nn.44, 165 (Del. Ch. Apr. 30, 2024) (holding that defendants had not breached their obligation to comply with contract's commercially-reasonable efforts provision). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The court went on:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
"Due regard" for the "efforts and costs" means that Defendants may eschew development where the circumstances reasonably indicate, as a business decision, that they not go forward. This includes all the costs and risks involved, including the milestone payments and the opportunity costs faced by Defendants, as evidenced by the provision that the reasonableness be measured against the actions expected of a company with "substantially the same resources and expertise" as the buyer. That is, if a reasonable actor with faced with the same restraints and risks would go forward <i>in its own self-interest</i>, the buyer is contractually obligated to do the same. <cite> <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original, extra paragraphing added). </cite>

Outside of the context of <i>efforts</i>, a party seeking to prove (or disprove) the reasonableness of a transaction, contract term, decision, etc., might want to focus on <i>the process</i> by which the transaction, etc., came into being. EXAMPLE: In its 1990 <i>West Texas Transmission</i> decision, the Fifth Circuit remarked that "[w]here two sophisticated businesses reach a hard-fought agreement through lengthy negotiations, it is difficult to conclude that any negotiated term placed in their contract is commercially unreasonable." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14571229305189389501">West Texas Transmission, LP v. Enron Corp.</a>, 907 F.2d 1554, 1563 (5th Cir. 1990) (affirrming district court's refusal to grant specific performance of right of first refusal) (extensive citations omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
This suggests that, when it comes to commercially-reasonable <i>efforts</i>, if parties can't (or don't want to take the time to) specify what outcome they want, then perhaps they could agree instead to a reasonable <i>process</i> that they will use later to decide what the outcome will be, such as the escalation clause at Protocol <a href="#r-escal-ext">2.6</a>.

<p>
A party that sues for breach of an efforts obligation might need to adduce specific evidence to educate the court about just what level of effort was required to meet the obligation in the particular circumstances — failing which, the court might dismiss the claim. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The SDNY explained: "When the term 'commercially reasonable efforts' is not defined by the contract, courts in this district require the party seeking to enforce the efforts provision to establish the objective standard by which the breaching party's efforts are to be judged, in the context of the particular industry." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=598465974293934143">Holland Loader Company, LLC v.

<p>
Parties that agree to include a best-efforts obligation in a contract can get into costly disputes about whether particular actions satisfied the obligation. That's because: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  With the benefit of plenty of time and <b>20-20 hindsight</b>, litigation counsel — <b>coached by</b> a paid expert witness — will second-guess the choices that the obligated party made.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Then it might be up to randomly-selected jurors to decide the best-efforts question — and because jurors often aren't familiar with the relevant business environment, they might end up deciding, in part, on the basis of which witnesses they liked best.

<p>
A best-efforts clause might be unenforceable if it doesn't indicate the desired object of the efforts with sufficient clarity to allow a court to assess the obligated party's performance.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Texas case, the buyer of a company had agreed, as part of the purchase agreement, to make <a href="#c-earn-out">earn-out payments</a> to the seller; the buyer also committed to use its best efforts to operate the acquired business "in a manner that maximizes the Earn-Out Payments &#x2026;." Affirming summary judgment in favor of the buyer, the court ruled that this best-efforts provision was unenforceable because "the contract at issue here lacks a clear set of guidelines against which <i>[the buyer's]</i> best efforts can be measured," and that what the contract <i>did</i> say on that score "is not enough to go on &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3885383475704791809">Spain v.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Fifth Circuit threw out a fraudulent-inducement jury verdict against a party alleged to have never intended to use its best efforts to promote sales of specified products: "Because the 'best efforts' clause is too indefinite and vague to provide a basis for enforcement, the [plaintiff's] claim for fraudulent inducement, as a matter of law, cannot rest on the alleged breach of this clause coupled with an alleged intent not to perform." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15072672150401870410">Kevin M.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-best-eff-analogy">
<p>
To many business people, it might seem self-evident that when a contract uses the term <i>best efforts</i>, it calls for "something more" than mere <i>reasonable efforts</i> — otherwise, why bother even saying <i>best efforts</i>? That is to say:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Reasonable efforts</i> will cover <i>a range</i> of possibilities;</li>

<li><i>best efforts</i> refers to <i>somewhere near the top</i> of that range.</li>
</ul>

<p>
By analogy:  On major U.S. highways, the speed-limit signs often include both maximum <i>and</i> minimum speeds of (say) 70 mph and 45 mph:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let's stipulate that those two speeds establish the upper- and lower bounds of reasonableness.</li>

<li>Now, suppose hypothetically that a trucking company agreed that its driver would use her "best efforts" to drive a shipment of goods from Point A to Point B on such a highway.</li>

<li>In good weather with light traffic, driving at <i>55</i> mph — that is, 10 mph above the minimum speed but 15 mph <i>below</i> the maximum speed — might qualify as <i>reasonable</i> efforts, but likely not as <i>best</i> efforts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Or to use a sports analogy: <i>Best efforts</i> means <i>bring your "A" game</i>, not your "C" game, even though C is a passing grade in (U.S.) schools, and arguably is equivalent to reasonable efforts.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-BestEffCompar">
<p>
On the best-efforts front: So-called comparables could be used in measuring compliance with a best-efforts obligation could be whether the obligated party had done what it had done in other, similar transactions; this can be seen in a Seventh Circuit opinion:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The term "best efforts" is a familiar one in contract parlance, and its meaning is especially plain in a case such as this where the promisor has similar contracts with other promisees. In such a case "best efforts" means the efforts the promisor has employed in those parallel contracts where the adequacy of his efforts have not been questioned. If Olympia worked as hard for Racine as it did for its other, but noncomplaining, customers, then it was using its best efforts within the meaning of the contract. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10706781448067598460">Olympia Hotels Corp. v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-BestEffortsBusContext">
<p>
<i>Asking for</i> best efforts can make business sense:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sure, there's some legal uncertainty associated with a best-efforts commitment.</li>

<li>But from a business perspective it can make good sense to ask the other side for such a commitment anyway: a party that makes a best-efforts commitment — to the extent that it later thinks about that commitment at all — will at least be aware that it might well have to make more than just routine, day-to-day, "reasonable" efforts. That alone might be worthwhile to the party asking for the commitment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the other hand: <i>Agreeing to make</i> best efforts could lead to trouble: If you commit to a best-efforts obligation, and the other side later accuses you of breaching that obligation, and you can't settle the dispute, then you're likely to have to try the case instead of being able to get rid of it on summary judgment.  That's because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As noted above: If a problem arises, then no matter what you did or didn't do, the other side's lawyers and expert witness(es), with 20-20 hindsight, will argue that there were X number of things that you supposedly <i>could</i> have done to achieve the agreed goal but didn't, and so you necessarily failed to use "best" efforts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.">Q.E.D</a>.</li>

<li>It might be difficult or impossible to get <i>summary</i> judgment that you didn't breach the best-efforts obligation, in which case you're likely to have to go to the trouble and expense of a full trial or arbitration hearing. The judge or arbitrator could well say that the question involves disputed issues of material fact — those issues would have to be resolved by witness testimony and cross-examination about such things as industry practices; the then-existing conditions; etc. According to the rules of procedure in many jurisdictions, that will require a trial and will not be able to be done in a summary proceeding. Your motion for summary judgment would then likely be denied.</li>

<li>The tribunal, after hearing the evidence, could find that <i>in fact</i> you did <i>not</i> use your best efforts. If that were to happen, you'd likely have a very hard time convincing an appeals court to overturn that finding.</li>

In <a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/2008/01/23/what-does-best-efforts-mean/">a 2008 blog posting</a>, Ken Adams seemed to insist that <i>best efforts</i> is in essence a synonym for <i>reasonable efforts</i>, and that therefore drafters should abjure the former term in favor of the latter. <cite> See Kenneth A.

<p>
To be sure, Ken does have at least some support in the case law for his position, as discussed at <a href="#best-eff-dil">13.1.2</a>. But that arguably amounts to lawyers telling clients, for no good reason: <i>No, you can't do your deal the way <b>you</b> want, because I say so</i>.

<p>
The export-controls laws in the U.S. are a bit complicated, but it’s extremely important for companies and counsel to get a handle on them. 
</p>

<p>
Here are a couple of examples of "exports" that might be surprising:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Disclosure of controlled technical data to a foreign national in the U.S. can constitute an "export" that requires either a license or a license exception.</li>

<li>Emailing controlled technical data to a U.S. citizen located in a foreign country could constitute an export of the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Want to do a few years in federal prison? Just do an "export" of technical data witout the required export license (or an applicable license exception). And even without prison time, you could be heavily fined and/or denied export privileges.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Ninth Circuit upheld an 85-month prison sentence for a Los Angeles-based <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi-chi-shih-9884bb20/">electrical engineer</a> for exporting to China, without an license, electronic devices to amplify microwave signals, <i>and</i> for evading national security controls in having the devices manufactured. The offense arose out of Shih’s collaboration with engineers in China in conducting research for a Chinese enterprise that develops military weapons. <cite> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/23-3718/23-3718-2024-10-25.html">United States v.

<p>
EXAMPLE: A dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran was sentenced to 30 months in prison, and agreed to pay a $50,000 fine, after pleading guilty to conspiring to illegally export finance-related technology to Iran; according to a Department of Justice press release:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
As set forth in court papers, by providing the Government of Iran and end users in Iran with sophisticated, top-tier U.S. electronic equipment and software, the defendant and his co-conspirators enabled the Iranian banking system to operate more efficiently, effectively, and securely. In doing so, the defendant and his co-conspirators likely helped strengthen Iran’s economy and provided faster and more secure access to funds that enable the Government of Iran to further priorities including its nuclear program and terrorist agenda — exactly what the U.S. sanctions against Iran were intended to prevent. <cite> U.S. Department of Justice, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/us-citizen-sentenced-30-months-prison-conspiring-provide-electronic-equipment-and">U.S. Citizen Sentenced to 30 Months in Prison for Conspiring to Provide Electronic Equipment and Technology to the Government of Iran</a> (justice.gov Feb. 9, 2023); see also Brandon Vigliarolo, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/10/us_citizen_smuggling_iran/">American jailed for smuggling controlled tech to Iran</a> (TheRegister.com Feb. 10, 2023). </cite>

Even without prison time, violation of export-controls regulations can lead to external oversight of a violator's business.

Honeywell's settlement with the government imposed some specific compliance-monitoring requirements, requiring Honeywell to hire an external compliance officer. <cite> <a href="https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/sys_attachment.do?sysparm_referring_url=tear_off&view=true&sys_id=113eab0b1bb764902dc36311f54bcb42">Charging document</a>; Press release: <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-department-of-state-concludes-13-million-settlement-of-alleged-export-violations-by-honeywell-international-inc/">U.S. Department of State Concludes $13 Million Settlement of Alleged Export Violations by Honeywell International, Inc.</a> (May 3, 2021). </cite>

Rarely, "extraordinary circumstances" might justify a departure from customary professional practice. In any situation in which a party asserts that extraordinary circumstances exist(ed); it'd be appropriate to consider the following questions, possibly among others:

<li>Does the situation qualify as <i>force majeure</i> (see <a href="#r-fmaj">16.2</a>)?</li>

From <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamGWaschEsq/status/1743682018091630897">a tweet</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Let’s talk briefly about franchisor insurance. Did you know that there is liability coverage available to franchise systems and their officers? 
</p>

<p>
Below is an example of a franchising services policy endorsement purchased by a startup. Upon review, insurers have some “outs” and may fight coverage of certain claims in the gray between covered and excluded claims; however, the insurer’s obligation to provide zors with a defense (a free litigator) to a franchisee claim is broader than coverage. Franchisor coverage up to $1M plus general liability is about $1K per month as a premium. Could be worth having in addition to on-call franchise counsel that focuses on compliance. 
</p>

<p>
Seems that the insurance industry needs to catch up with the times referencing “Uniform Franchise Offering Circular” in 2024 more than 16 years after that term has been replaced with Franchise Disclosure Document. Would an insurer deny a claim related to the “FDD” without reference to a UFOC? Probably no but the change in policy language should be made.
</p>

<p>
Hope this is helpful to someone. DMs open for questions.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-gfaith-gen-impl-cov">
<p>
It depends:
</p>

<p>
A.&nbsp; Unlike the law in many other states, <b>Texas law doesn't impose a general duty</b> of good faith and fair dealing in contractual relationships. As explained in <i>Subaru</i> (Tex. 2002), in that state, such a duty arises only in specific, limited circumstances: "A common-law duty of good faith and fair dealing does not exist in all contractual relationships. Rather, the duty arises only when a contract creates or governs a special relationship between the parties." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16602806731795093132">Subaru of America, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Somewhat similarly, Delaware law takes a cautious approach in applying the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; as the state's supreme court explained:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; <i>Under Delaware law, sophisticated parties are bound by the terms of their agreement</i>. Even if the bargain they strike ends up a bad deal for one or both parties, the court’s role is to enforce the agreement as written. &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
There are, however, instances when parties fail to foresee events not covered by their agreement or defer decisions to later. No contract, regardless of how tightly or precisely drafted it may be, can wholly account for every possible contingency.
</p>

<p>
<i>Subject to the express terms of the agreement, when gaps in an agreement lead to controversy</i>, the court has in its toolbox the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing <i>to fill in the spaces</i> between the written words. &#x2026; The implied covenant, however, is a cautious enterprise. &#x2026; <i>It cannot be invoked when the contract addresses the conduct at issue.</i> The implied covenant should not have been deployed in this case. <i>There was no gap to fill in the Agreement.</i> &#x2026; <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6587312515760085993">Glaxo Group Ltd. v. DRIT LP</a>, 248 A.3d 911, 919-20 (Del. 2021) (reversing, in part, trial-court judgment) (cleaned up, formatting revised). To similar effect, see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?Value">case=7352410918828249241 Health Solutions, Inc. v. Pharma. Research Assoc., Inc.</a>, 891 S.E.2d 100 (N.C. 2023), part IV.B.1 (affirming dismissal of breach-of-contract claim). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>California's</b> implied covenant can't be used to "retrade the deal," as explained in <i>Guz</i> (Cal. 2000):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
But while the implied covenant requires mutual fairness in applying a contract's actual terms, it cannot substantively <i>alter</i> those terms.
</p>

<p>
If an employment is at will, and thus allows either party to terminate <i>for any or no reason</i>, the implied covenant cannot decree otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, although any breach of the actual terms of an employment contract also violates the implied covenant, the measure of damages for such a breach remains solely contractual.
</p>

<p>
Hence, where breach of an actual term is alleged, a separate implied covenant claim, based on the same breach, is superfluous. On the other hand, where an implied covenant claim alleges a breach of obligations beyond the agreement's actual terms, it is invalid. <cite> Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 352, 358, 8 P.3d 1089, 1110 (2000) (emphasis in original, extra paragraphing added); <i>see also id.</i>, 24 Cal. 4th at 373-77; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11511170839417744592">Derby v.

<p>
To be on the safe side, some drafters might be tempted to disclaim the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. But imagine how that could look to a judge or juror if the disclaimer were to be worded badly:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org81c511b">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Under the Federal Supply Schedule Program, the General Services Administration (GSA) acts as the contracting agent for the federal government and <b>negotiates base contracts with suppliers of commercial products and services</b>. 
</p>

<p>
These base (or schedule) contracts streamline the acquisition process for federal agencies and allow them to take advantage of the flexible and dynamic commercial market-pricing environment, so all federal customers, regardless of size or location, can <b>place orders directly with contractors and receive the same services, convenience, and pricing.</b>
</p>

<p>
The Federal Supply Schedule Program closely mirrors commercial buying practices. But, instead of evaluating prices head to head in a competitive environment, GSA assesses pricing as it relates to the offeror's commercial selling practices. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An offeror submits a completed commercial sales practices sheet along with supporting documentation that discloses commercial pricing, market participants, sell price, and terms and conditions for the offeror's "<b>most favored customer</b>" in a competitive environment.</li>

<li>Relying on this information and in accordance with the Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR), a GSA contracting officer determines whether the pricing is "fair and reasonable" not as it relates to the competitive environment but as it relates to the offerror's commercial selling practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Should the contracting officer accept the offer, the Federal Supply Schedule Program allows executive agencies to issue orders for those commercial products pursuant to the underlying GSA contract.

<p>
"Have-used" rights might be important to a party ("licensee") that is authorized to use another party's trade secret, patented invention, copyrighted work of authorship, or other asset. For that reason, the licensee might want to negotiate to allow the licensee's <i>contractors</i> to use the IP or other asset in question.

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Great Minds</i> (2d Cir. 2018), certain schools paid FedEx Office to make copies of materials licensed by a nonprofit organization under a Creative Commons license (referred to in the decision as a "public license") that prohibited "commercial use." The copyright holder sued FedEx, claiming that FedEx's copying was "commercial" and so was not authorized under that license. But the Second Circuit, affirming dismissal of the claim, held that the copying <i>by FedEx</i> still qualified as "noncommercial," even though FedEx had charged the schools for making the copies:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The public license does not explicitly address whether licensees may engage third parties to provide commercial services that assist the licensees in furthering their own noncommercial uses. 
</p>

<p>
We hold that a copyright holder must state in its license any limitation it might wish to impose precluding such an engagement. We decline to infer any such limitation in Great Minds' public license, and therefore AFFIRM the District Court's judgment.

Under Texas law, an insurance carrier doesn't owe a general fiduciary duty to its insured, and so would not be liable for providing the insured with a policy containing the requested coverage instead of recommending higher policy limits. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1579861241548593741">Century Surety Co. v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-ins-clm-notif">
<p>
Insurance policies generally impose deadlines for the insured to notify the carrier (the insurance company) of a potential claim. Failure to meet those deadlines can result in loss of coverage. 
</p>

<p>
Some jurisdictions are stricter than others on that point. For example, when the policy is of the claims-made type, the "majority view" is that, if the claim was made during the policy period but after a shorter stated deadline, then the carrier must show that it was prejudiced by the insured's failure to meet the stated deadline.  As explained by the Eleventh Circuit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The majority of courts who have opined on this issue have applied the notice-prejudice rule, which establishes that when an insured provides notice within the policy period of a claims-made policy (the first type of notice), and breaches only the requirement that it also provide notice within a specified period of time (the second type of notice), coverage is not automatically lost. 
</p>

<p>
Instead, the insurer needs to show prejudice in order to bar coverage: "Most courts have applied the notice-prejudice rule to traditional claims-made policies that require notice or reporting to the insurer 'promptly' or 'as soon as practicable.'"

<li>In almost any kind of contract, strongly consider recommending to the client that the client check with its insurance broker to see whether any additional coverage is appropriate.</li>

<li>When recommending this to the client,  do it <b>in writing</b>, e.g., in a quick, informal email, to leave a paper trail.</li>

<li>When drafting or negotiating a services contract for the customer: Consider including specific, mandatory insurance requirements for the contractor with:

<li>a requirement that the <b>insurance carrier</b> must furnish the customer with a certificate of additional-insured status <b>before</b> the contracctor starts work;</li>

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>7.3 Insurance.</b> Contractor shall procure and maintain for the duration of the contract insurance against claims for injuries to persons or damages to property which may arise from or in connection with the performance of the work hereunder and the results of that work by Contractor, his agents, representatives, employees or subcontractors. Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, the following:
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.1 Commercial General Liability.</b> Insurance Services Office Form CG 00 01 covering CGL on an “occurrence” basis, including products and completed operations, property damage, bodily injury, and personal and advertising injury with limits no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence.
</p>

<p>
If a general aggregate limit applies, either the general aggregate limit shall apply separately to this project/location (ISO CG 25 03 or 25 04) or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the required occurrence limit.
</p>

<p>
<i>[DCT note: Drafters should check to be sure that the ISO forms listed in this excerpt are the current versions.]</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.2 Commercial Automobile Liability.</b> Insurance Services Office Form Number CA 0001 covering Code 1 (any auto) or, if Contractor has no owned autos, Code 8 (hired) and 9 (non-owned), with limit no less than $1,000,000 per accident for bodily injury and property damage.  <i>[DCT note: See the note above about checking for outdated form versions.]</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.3 Workers' Compensation.</b> Insurance as required by the State of California, with Statutory Limits, and Employer’s Liability Insurance with limit of no less than $1,000,000 per accident for bodily injury or disease.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.4 Professional Liability (Errors and Omissions).</b> For consultant contracts, insurance appropriate to Consultant’s profession, with limit no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence or claim, $2,000,000 aggregate.
</p>

<p>
If Contractor maintains broader coverage and/or higher limits than the minimums shown above, City requires and shall be entitled to the broader coverage and/or the higher limits maintained by Contractor. <i>[DCT note: This could be significant in Texas cases, as discussed at <a href="#TOAIA">16.3.13.11</a> concerning the Texas Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act.]</i>
</p>

<p>
Any available insurance proceeds in excess of the specified minimum limits of insurance and coverage shall be available to City.
</p>

<p>
<i>DCT note: Consider also: &bull; <b>cyber insurance</b> &bull; <b>reps and warranties insurance</b> &bull; <b>excess- or umbrella coverage</b>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5 Other Insurance Provisions.</b> The insurance policies are to contain, or be endorsed to contain, the following provisions:
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5.1 Additional Insured Status.</b> The City, its officers, officials, employees, and volunteers are to be covered as additional insureds on the CGL policy with respect to liability arising out of work or operations performed by or on behalf of Contractor including materials, parts, or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations. 
</p>

<p>
General liability coverage can be provided in the form of an endorsement to Contractor’s insurance (at least as broad as ISO Form CG 20 10 11 85 or if not available, through the addition of both CG 20 10, CG 20 26, CG 20 33, or CG 20 38; and CG 20 37 if a later edition is used).  <i>[DCT note: See the note above about checking for outdated form versions.]</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5.2 Primary Coverage.</b> For any claims related to this contract, Contractor’s insurance coverage shall be primary coverage at least as broad as ISO CG 20 01 04 13 as respects the City, its officers, officials, employees, and volunteers.  <i>[DCT note: See the note above about checking for outdated form versions.]</i>
</p>

<p>
Any insurance or self-insurance maintained by City, its officers, officials, employees, or volunteers shall be excess of Contractor’s insurance and shall not contribute with it.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5.3 Notice of Cancellation.</b> Each insurance policy required above shall provide that coverage shall not be canceled, except with notice to City. <i>[DCT note: Folk wisdom among some attorneys is many insurance carriers generally won't commit to doing more than</i> endeavoring <i>to provide notice of cancelation.]</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5.4 Waiver of Subrogation.</b> Contractor hereby grants to City a waiver of any right to subrogation which the Workers’ Compensation insurer of said Contractor may acquire against City by virtue of the payment of any loss under such insurance.  <i>[DCT note: A waiver of subrogation means, generally, that Contractor's insurance carrier: (i) must pay for insured losses even if the losses were the City's fault; and (ii) cannot sue City to recoup the carrier's payments for such losses that were the City's fault; see <a href="#nl-subrog-cmt">28.24.7</a> for additional discussion.]</i>
</p>

<p>
Contractor agrees to obtain any endorsement that may be necessary to affect this waiver of subrogation, but this provision applies regardless of whether or not the City has received a waiver ofsubrogation endorsement from the insurer.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5.5 Claims Made Policies</b> (applicable only to professional liability). The Retroactive Date must be shown, and must be before the date of the contract or the beginning of contract work. 
</p>

<p>
Insurance must be maintained and evidence of insurance must be provided for at least five (5) years after completion of the contract of work.
</p>

<p>
If coverage is canceled or nonrenewed, and not replaced with another claims-made policy form with a Retroactive Date prior to the contract effective date, Contractor must purchase “extended reporting” coverage for a minimum of five (5) years after completion of work.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.4 Self Insured Retentions.</b> Self-insured retentions must be declared to and approved by City.
</p>

<p>
City may require Contractor to purchase coverage with a lower retention or provide proof of ability to pay losses and related investigations, claim administration, and defense expenses within the retention. The policy language shall provide, or be endorsed to provide, that the self-insured retention may be satisfied by either the named insured or City.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.5 Acceptability of Insurers.</b> Insurance is to be placed with insurers with a current A.M. Best’s rating of no less than A-VI, unless otherwise acceptable to City. <i>[DCT note: See <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/a-m-best.asp">AM Best</a> (Investopedia.com).]</i> 
</p>

<p>
City will accept insurance provided by non-admitted, “surplus lines” carriers only if the carrier is authorized to do business in the State of California and is included on the List of Approved Surplus Lines Insurers (LASLI list).
</p>

<p>
All policies of insurance carried by non-admitted carriers are subject to all of the requirements for policies of insurance provided by admitted carriers described herein.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.6 Verification of Coverage.</b> Contractor shall furnish City with original certificates and amendatory endorsements or copies of the applicable policy language effecting coverage required by this clause.
</p>

<p>
All certificates and endorsements are to be received and approved by City before work commences.
</p>

<p>
However, failure to obtain the required documents prior to the work beginning shall not waive Contractor’s obligation to provide them.
</p>

<p>
City reserves the right to require complete, certified copies of all required insurance policies, including endorsements required by these specifications, at any time.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.7 Special Risks or Circumstances.</b> City reserves the right to modify these requirements, including limits, based on the nature of the risk, prior experience, insurer, coverage, or other special circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.8 Additional Insurance.</b> Contractor may obtain additional insurance not required by this Contract.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.9 Excess Insurance.</b> All policies providing excess coverage to City shall follow the form of the primary policy or policies including but not limited to all endorsements.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.10 Subcontractors.</b> Contractor shall require and verify that all subcontractors maintain insurance meeting all the requirements stated herein, and Contractor shall ensure that City is an additional insured on insurance required from subcontractors. 
</p>

<p>
For CGL coverage, subcontractors shall provide coverage with a format at least as broad as the CG 20 38 04 13 endorsement.  <i>[DCT note: See the note above about checking for outdated form versions.]</i>

Allied World Specialty Ins. Co.</a>, 67 F.4th 672, 674-75 (5th Cir. 2023) (affirming summary judgment in favor of insured); no copyright is claimed in the opinion text.</i>
</p>

<p>
In a diversity case involving the interpretation of a contract, we apply the substantive law of the forum state. 
</p>

<p>
Under Texas law, insurance policies are interpreted in accordance with the rules of construction that apply to all contracts generally. 
</p>

<p>
The insured bears the initial burden of showing that there is coverage, while the insurer bears the burden of proving the applicability of any exclusions in the policy. 
</p>

<p>
In construing a contract, a court’s primary concern is to ascertain the intentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument. As with any other contract, the parties’ intent is governed by what they said. We look at the language of the policy because we presume parties intend what the words of their contract say.
</p>

<p>
Under Texas’s so-called "eight-corners rule," the insurer’s duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint to the policy provisions, without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations and without reference to facts otherwise known or ultimately proven.
</p>

<p>
When applying the rule, we give the allegations in the complaint a liberal interpretation.
</p>

<p>
In case of doubt as to whether or not the allegations of a complaint against the insured state a cause of action within the coverage of a liability policy sufficient to compel the insurer to defend the action, such doubt will be resolved in the insured’s favor.
</p>

<p>
Or as this court has previously summed it up: When in doubt, defend.

<i>DCT note: In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10758647507804592258">Carter v. Pulte Home Corp.</a>, 52 Cal. App.5th 571 (2020), the court summarized the law of subrogation in that state. The description below is adapted from the court's opinion (at 578), with citations omitted.</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Subrogation is</b> the substitution of another person in place of the creditor or claimant to whose rights he or she succeeds in relation to the debt or claim.
</p>

<p>
In the case of insurance, subrogation takes the form of the right of an insurance company (the "carrier") to be put in the position of the carrier's customer (the "insured"). 
</p>

<p>
If the carrier pays its insured for a loss caused by a third party, then the <i>carrier</i> can sue the third party to recover the carrier's payment (as well as the insured's deductible).
</p>

<p>
<b>The subrogated carrier is said to "stand in the shoes" of its insured,</b> because the carrier has no greater rights than the insured, and it's subject to the same defenses that the third party could assert against the insured.
</p>

<p>
Thus, a carrier can't acquire by subrogation anything to which the insured doesn't already have rights.
</p>

<p>
Subrogation goes even farther: As now applied, the doctrine of <i>equitable</i> subrogation is broad enough to include every instance in which one person, not acting as a mere volunteer or intruder, pays a debt for which a third party is primarily liable, and which in equity and good conscience should have been taken care of by the third party.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<i>In some contracts, a waiver of subrogation might be unconscionable; see <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/subrogation-waiver-unconscionable-in-2970665">Bennett</a> (JDSupra 2024), discussing <a href="https://jud.ct.gov/Superiorcourt/MOD/DocumentPreview.aspx">American Commerce Ins. v.

DCT note: As a personal example, one evening in July 1984 my Honda Accord was T-boned at an intersection by a fast-moving pickup truck that ran the red light — and whose driver had no insurance. I wasn't hurt but my car suffered significant damage. 
</p>

<p>
My insurance carrier, USAA, paid to have my car repaired, and for a rental car. USAA then hired a sole-practitioner lawyer to sue the pickup truck's drive — who didn't file an answer and so had a default judgment entered against him. The lawyer promptly had the judgment recorded in the courthouse records; the amount of the judgment covered USAA's payments and my deductible.
</p>

<p>
Not long afterwards, the pickup truck's driver contacted the lawyer to work out a payment plan. (If I recall correctly, the driver had found that the recorded judgment was preventing him from getting credit.) The driver made monthly payments until the judgment was paid off, at which point the lawyer filed a release of the judgment.

Lawyers are (in)famous for making arguments about contract meaning that are just utter BS. And only seldom do courts ever call them on such arguments — probably because lawyers' ethical duty of zealous advocacy gets inflated into an excuse for bad behavior.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Days Inn Worldwide</i> (D.N.J. 2025), a federal court held that the term "reasonable attorney fees" in an indemnification provision was <i>not</i> indefinite, rejecting the defendant's contrary argument:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Instead, <i>[the defendants]</i> argue the entire indemnification provision must be held unenforceable due to vagueness or ambiguity because <b>"reasonable attorneys' fees" is not explicitly defined</b>, and that <b>the entire License Agreement becomes null and void</b> as a result of this undefined essential term. However, such a holding is neither supported by case law, as <b>courts routinely uphold</b> similar indemnification clauses, <b>nor do Defendants point the Court</b> to any analogous situation where the use of "reasonable attorneys' fees," without definition, rendered such a provision unenforceable, <b>much less an entire contract</b>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18247234679669500712">Days Inns Worldwide, Inc. v. 4200 Rose Hospitality LLC</a>, No. 2:22-cv-04822, slip op.

<b>Client pressure:</b> In <i>Bandera Master Fund</i> (Del. 2025), a Baker Botts partner "appeared to be caught between his law partners, who were hesitant about various essential elements of <i>[a particular legal opinion that the client wanted]</i>, and his client &#x2026;." who wanted the opinion. The court of chancery savaged the Baker Botts opinion, holding that the firm had rendered its opinion in bad faith to give a forceful client the result it wanted, awarding nearly $690 billion in damages and interest for breach of contract. A 3-2 majority of the state's supreme court affirmed the chancery court's findings on that issue as supported by competent evidence (but reversed and remanded on other issues). <cite> See <a href="https://cases.justia.com/delaware/supreme-court/2025-439-2024.pdf#page=24">Bandera Master Fund LP v.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Section 6.2, titled “Duties of the Managing Members,” provides that:
</p>

<p>
The Managing Members shall be responsible for the day-
to-day management of the Company’s business and affairs
and shall devote such time and effort to the Company as
shall reasonably be required for its welfare and success.
The Managing Members shall coordinate meetings,
conference calls, and communicate as reasonably required
subject to a meeting once every other meeting [sic]. With
respect to contractual and legal matters handled by the
Managing Members, McMillan shall provide and make the
final decision on such business and legal matters.
Specifically, except as otherwise limited in this Agreement,
the Managing Members are authorized to own, hold,
manage, administer, operate, lease, sell, exchange, pledge,
encumber, transfer, purchase, grant options related to, and
otherwise deal with the Company assets in Delaware or
any other state on behalf of the Company, except as
otherwise provided in Section 6.3. In the event any
Managing Member fails to be able to perform his
responsibilities or fails to provide day-to-day management
of the Company, such Managing Member can be removed
and/or replaced by the vote of the Members subject to the
remaining Managing Member’s mutual consent . . . .53
Section 6.5, titled “Members Who Are Not a Managing Member” provides:
A Member who is not a Managing Member shall not
participate in the control of the Company’s affairs and shall
have no right or authority to act for or to bind the
Company. The Member hereby consents to the exercise by
the Managing Members of the powers conferred by this
Agreement and to the employment, when and if the same
is deemed necessary or advisable, of such brokers, agents,
accountants, attorneys, and such other advisors as the
Managing Members may determine to be appropriate for
the management of the Company business, subject to
consultation with all the Members.54
</p>

<p>
Section 6.3, titled “Limitations on Authority of Managing Members,” identifies
28 actions over which Non-Managing Members have a say. As to nine of the 28
actions, consent of 100% of the Members’ Percent Interest is required.55 As to the
remaining 19, the agreement provides that: “Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 6.2 above: (a) the consent of at least sixty-six and two thirds percent (66 2/3
%) of the Percentage Interests then held by the Members shall be required to do any
of the following: . . .”56 The list of 19 actions includes: “Amend this Agreement, except
as otherwise provided in Section 6.2.”57
</p>

<p>
Plaintiffs interpret these provisions collectively to prohibit a Non-Managing Member from participating in the control of the Company or seeking to bind the Company, including by amending the LLC Agreement and proposing agenda items.[58] 
</p>

<p>
<i>[And the court agrees: Trying to amend the LLC agreement violates the management clause!]</i>
</p>

<p>
Section 5.3 provides:
</p>

<p>
The Members shall meet no less than required under the Act and shall meet every other month to provide meaningful input and consultation on matters related to the Company. During the Member Meetings, the Members shall have the right to review the then current bank statements of the Company.[62]
</p>

<p>
The language "meaningful input and consultation" is a marked departure from words like "direction" or "control" and emphasizes the limited and advisory role that Non-Managing Members play under the parties' contractual scheme. It is also a marked departure from the specific right set out in the second sentence of Section 5.3—to review then-current bank statements. The second sentence reflects that the drafters of the LLC Agreement knew how to grant affirmative rights to Non-Managing Members, but failed to do so in the way that Defendants suggest.
</p>

<p>
* * *
</p>

<p>
Contrary to Defendants' assertion, Section 13.3 does not support their interpretation of Section 6.3(a)(19). Section 13.3 is a formalities clause that sets forth the mechanics for an amendment to the LLC Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(19)—that is, one approved by the Managing Members with the consent of 66 2/3% of the Percentage Interests. Any such amendment must be in writing and signed by at least 66 2/3% of the Members' Percent Interests for it to be valid and binding. <b>It does not confer on the Non-Managing Members the power to unilaterally propose and adopt amendments</b>. Nor does it trump Section 6.5 and the prohibition on non-Managing Members binding the Company as Defendants purported to do by amending the LLC Agreement.

<a href="https://www.jimersonfirm.com/blog/2023/01/strategies-drafting-effective-operating-agreement/">From here</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Strategy #1 Consider Hypotheticals Scenarios 
</p>

<p>
Writing a list of hypothetical scenarios that would impact the operations of an LLC can allow members to solve problems before they ever occur. 
</p>

<p>
Members should consider making a list of hypothetical scenarios that could affect the LLC or its members, including situations such as death, divorce, or a member disappearing to Tahiti. 
</p>

<p>
After making a list of hypothetical scenarios, members should discuss the desired result and incorporate provisions needed to achieve that result into the operating agreement. 
</p>

<p>
Planning for every situation will always remain impossible. However, drafting an operating agreement that considers specific situations can allow members to solve problems before they arise in the future. 
</p>

<p>
Strategy #2 Consider the Tax Implications
</p>

<p>
LLCs are the most flexible legal entity available. LLCs can have (and frequently do have) tax statuses different from their legal entity status. 
</p>

<p>
Under the default tax rules, LLCs with more than one member are taxable as a partnership, and LLCs with a single member are taxable as a disregarded entity. However, LLCs can also elect to be taxable as a C corporation or an S corporation (when eligible). Therefore, operating agreements should incorporate tax-specific provisions that reflect the intended tax status and comply with applicable tax code provisions. 
</p>

<p>
Strategy #3 Consider Voting Rights 
</p>

<p>
LLCs provide tremendous flexibility with member voting. 
</p>

<p>
A common technique when structuring an LLC and writing an operating agreement is to create different classes of equity that provides different voting rights to members. 
</p>

<p>
For example, an operating agreement can include provisions that issues Class A equity and Class B equity, with members owning Class A equity having greater rights, sole voting rights, or no voting rights. 
</p>

<p>
Operating agreements can also allow classes of equity to vote only on specific matters. 
</p>

<p>
Other than major LLC decisions (merger, sale, etc.), members of an LLC are free to alter their voting rights through an operating agreement. 
</p>

<p>
Strategy #4 Consider the Exit
</p>

<p>
Every member of an LLC will have an exit. There are various types of exit events that need to be considered when drafting an operating agreement, including redemptions, dissolutions and wind-downs, and interest sales. 
</p>

<p>
Exit planning can get tricky when exit terms are not included into the operating agreement, forcing members to negotiate and resolve matters amongst themselves. 
</p>

<p>
Having defined terms in the operating agreement that provides clear terms and procedures will ensure members can exit the LLC as quickly, efficiently, and fairly as possible. 
</p>

<p>
Strategy #5 Consider Restrictive Covenants
</p>

<p>
Employment agreements frequently include restrictive covenants. However, operating agreements can impose similar restrictive covenants upon managers or members. 
</p>

<p>
For example, an operating agreement can prohibit members from soliciting employees, competing with the LLC, or disclosing confidential information. 
</p>

<p>
Although the Florida Revised Limited Liability Company Act provides some restrictions on competition, operating agreements can be drafted to include restrictive covenants that impose greater or lesser restrictions on members or managers. 
</p>

<p>
Operating agreements can also provide the LLC with specific remedies following a breach that may not otherwise be available under the law.
</p>

<p>
Strategy #6 Consider Deadlocks
</p>

<p>
Manager or member voting deadlock can render LLC operations impossible. However, operating agreements can include specific deadlock-breaking mechanisms that allow deadlocks to be decided based on procedures that were previously agreed upon by the members. 
</p>

<p>
Members are free to get creative with their deadlock provisions and can utilize any tie-breaking mechanism they can think of, such as coin flips, rounds of golf, or having a 3rd party decide the issue. 
</p>

<p>
Incorporating deadlock provisions into an operating agreement will ensure that the LLC can still function even when its members or managers cannot agree.
</p>

<p>
Strategy #7 Consider Ownership
</p>

<p>
LLC members are often individuals. However, LLC interests can also be owned by entities, trusts, other legal entities, or spouses as tenants by the entireties. 
</p>

<p>
Considering the potential advantages and disadvantages of each ownership type must be considered when drafting an operating agreement and structuring an LLC. 
</p>

<p>
Ensuring the operating agreement has the language needed to effectuate the desired ownership structure is critical to preserve flexibility and avoid potential challenges in the future.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-28-30">
<p>
In 1L Contracts class, we all learned about about the doctrine of mutual mistake, under which a court might decline to enforce a contract if <i>both parties</i> made the same mistake about an important underlying fact. 
</p>

<p>
But the mistake must be mutual; as the Eleventh Circuit explained in a 2022 decision, courts will not intervene on behalf of a party that failed to do its homework or that accepted sloppy contract language:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Drummond argues that the mutual mistake here was that the parties thought that BHP always set the quarterly benchmark price, when in fact, prior to entering the Agreement, companies other than BHP had set the quarterly benchmark price. However, this does not appear to be an issue of a mutual mistake, but rather a lack of due diligence by these sophisticated parties before entering the Agreement. &#x2026; At best, this was a <i>unilateral</i> mistake on the part of Drummond. The only apparent <i>mutual</i> mistake here was a poorly drafted contract. Therefore, Drummond’s claim for equitable reformation fails. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2461051742924040526">Southern Coal Corp. v. Drummond Coal Sales, Inc.</a>, 25 F.4th 864, 873 (11th Cir. 2022) (affirming, in relevant part, judgment that pricing-adjustment clause was unenforceable because agreed benchmark was no longer published; rejecting mutual-mistake argument). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-rcrdn-nts">
<p>
Drafters should consider whether the law might require (or simply permit) recording certain types of contract in the public records, so as to put third parties on notice. <i>EXAMPLE:</i>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <i>Membership campgrounds:</i> An Oregon statute, <a href="https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_94.953">Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 94.953</a>&#x2013;989, imposes requirements for recordation (among other things) for sales of "membership campground contracts." <cite> See <a href="https://cdm17027.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p17027coll3/id/14147/rec/1">Adelsperger v.

<p>
&#x2013;  <i>Leases:</i> Various state laws allow, or require, recordation of certain leases or of a "memorandum of lease."

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org348b787">
<p>
Many business dealings require parties to depend on information provided by other parties. For some such contract relationships, one party might want to propose that the other side keep specified records. This could be important because, for example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the saying, <i>trust, but verify</i> (discussed in the introduction to Protocol <a href="#r-audit-proto">9.1</a>), a contractual right to audit a party's books and records might be of little value if the contract doesn't also specify what kind of records are to be kept.</li>

<li>The party asking for records to be kept might be required to do so by law or by a flowdown obligation.</li>

<li>If the other party is reluctant to agree to reasonable recordkeeping requirements, it <i>could</i> be a red-flag warning that the other party is sloppy in other areas.</li>

<p>
Here are a couple of common examples:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  A commercial lease might require the tenant to pay not just a base rent, but also a percentage of gross revenue, which the tenant must record and periodically report to the landlord. <cite> See generally the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_rent">Percentage rent</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  A technology license agreement might require the licensee to pay the licensor a royalty computed as a percentage of the licensee's gross- or net sales involving the licensed technology, as reported periodically by the licensee. <cite> See generally the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment">Royalty payment</a>. </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-rec-kind">
<p>

<p>
Parties might want to consider adapting the standard record-retention periods found in the [U.S.] Federal Acquisition Regulations; for that purpose, language could be considered along the following lines: <cite> See, e.g., <a href="http://goo.gl/8JbNAD">Contractor Records Retention</a>, 48 C.F.R. §§ 4.703(a)(1), 4.705. </cite>
</p>

<div class="alt" id="orge980846">
<p>
1.  The Rec&shy;ord&shy;keep&shy;er must cause each of the Records to be maintained for at least the period that the record would be required to be maintained under the (U.S.) Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FARs"), <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title48-vol1/pdf/CFR-2010-title48-vol1-part4-subpart4-7.pdf">Contractor Records Retention</a>, 48 C.F.R.

<p>
2.  For clarity: This section is intended merely as a convenient shorthand reference in lieu of setting out the cited substantive record-retention terms; the parties do not intend to imply or concede that the Con&shy;tract and/or their relationship are in fact subject to the FARs.

<p>
"Reverse engineering" of a product can take the form, generally, of one or more of disassembling the product to study its design, and/or operating the product and observing its behavior, then using that information to try to figure out what's going on inside.

Waivers of reverse-engineering rights are routinely enforced in the U.S., on grounds that a recipient is free to contractually bargain away those rights. EXAMPLE: A Houston property-management company was hit with a $152 million jury verdict (later reduced to $62.5 millon to eliminate duplication), <b>and</b> barred from developing property-management software for two years. The company was found to have reverse-engineered a software vendor's product in violation of a prohibition in the license agreement — the jury evidently didn't believe the property-management company's claim that it developed its own software without using the vendor's software.

In a case involving a genteel turf battle between U.S. and UK courts, a UK software company, World Programming Ltd., wanted to compete with American statistical-software maker SAS Institute:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>World Programming acquired a low-cost "learning edition" of the SAS software.</li>

<li>To install, the software, World Programming clicked on an "I agree" button to assent to the terms of SAS's end-user license agreement ("EULA"). World Programming then studied the SAS software, in effect reverse-engineering it, to help World Programing develop its own competitive software.</li>

<li>A federal jury in North Carolina found World Programming liable for <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fraud_in_the_inducement">fraudulent inducement</a> and awarded SAS $26 million in damages — which was trebled to some $79 million under a state law. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16513132163553473257">SAS Institute, Inc. v.

<li>But that wasn't the only aspect of the case: The parties filed competing lawsuits, with litigation in U.S. federal courts in North Carolina and California as well as in the UK, where courts held that the reverse-engineering prohibition in SAS's end-user license agreement ("EULA") was unenforceable in the EU under the European Union Software Directive. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2189887973333132976">SAS Institute, Inc. v.

When oil giant Chevron acquired Hess Corporation, Chevron's competitor ExxonMobil sought to exercise a right of first refusal ("ROFR") to acquire Hess's stake in the oil and gas reservoir known as the Stabroek block, located in the Atlantic Ocean off Guyana in northern South America. An International Chamber of Commerce arbitration tribunal rejected ExxonMobil's claim, along with that of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation ("CNOOC"): The arbitration panel is thought to have ruled that under the contract's wording, the ROFR was not triggered by Chevron's acquisition of Hess. <cite> See Nadine Amr, Sophie Freelove, Louise Woods, and Honor Soames, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-stabroek-joa-arbitration-is-it-time-4901267">The Stabroek JOA Arbitration: Is It Time to Revisit JOA Change in Control Provisions?</a> (JDSupra.com). </cite>

<p>
The concept of severability addresses the question: If one part of a contract — such as some or all of an arbitration provision — is held to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, will the rest of the contract likewise be unenforceable? "Severability" means that a court or other tribunal can ditch (so to speak) the unenforceable part of the contract and proceed with dealing with the rest of the contract.
</p>

<p>
Whether to agree to severance of an invalidated provision is always an issue worth pondering, because from the perspective of a given party, the invalidated provision might be critical to the value of the entire agreement.

<p>
The Vendor's take-or-pay arrangement with Reseller might not serve the Vendor's desire to penetrate a market by making sales to actual customers. 
</p>

<p>
And even worse, consider this hypothetical: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reseller makes a deal with Vendor A for <i>exclusive</i> rights to sell Vendor A's <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/widget">widgets</a> in a particular territory, with a take-or-pay arrangement but no other obligation to "push" Vendor A's widgets.</li>

<li>Reseller approaches a competing Vendor B with an offer: <i>Hey, Vendor B: If you'll cover my take-or-pay payment obligations to Vendor A, then I won't make any effort to sell Vendor A's widgets, and instead I'll sell</i> your <i>widgets; that way, because I've got exclusivity for Vendor A's widgets, it follows that you won't have Vendor A as a competitor in the territory at all</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Depending on the economics, competing Vendor B might find such a lock-out proposal to be an attractive way of eliminating competition from Vendor A in the territory.
</p>

<p>
True, such a lock-out deal between Reseller and the competing Vendor B might create antitrust issues. But antitrust lawsuits are slow, complex, and most of all, expensive; Vendor A would likely prefer simply not to agree to an <i>exclusive</i> take-or-pay arrangement in the first place. 
</p>

<p>
A take-or-pay arrangement could create less-threatening problems for Vendor A: Suppose that competing Vendor B offered to pay Reseller and/or <i>its sales people</i> an extra bonus (often known as a "spiff") for selling Vendor B's widgets. That would give Reseller's sales people an incentive to give preferential treatment to Vendor B's widgets. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiff">Spiff</a> (Wikipedia.org).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-28-42-1">
<p>
A "meta" goal of this book is to give parties — both vendors and customers — some tools —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to help them identify prospective counterparties that might be less than reliable business partners; and</li>
<li>to signal their own reliability.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This stems from a contract lawyer's <i>primary</i> mission, which (in the author's view) is to help the client:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>not just steer clear of the various "rocks and shoals" that can disrupt — or even sink — a business deal; but</li>
<li>also advance the client's short- and long-term business goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So consider the business motivations of vendors and their customers:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On the whole, vendors strongly prefer to get repeat business from good customers who have a track record of timely payment. That's because getting <i>new</i> customers is costly and time-consuming — new customers have to be found, qualified, and convinced to buy — plus, there's always the financial risk that a <i>new</i> customer could turn out to be a  deadbeat that doesn't pay its bills.</li>

<li>Similarly, customers generally prefer to work with reliable vendors who've demonstrated that they'll "be there" for their customers. This was brought home, for example, in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown and attendant supply-chain disruptions, as well as the West Coast shipping strike threat.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We can paraphrase how a team from leading consulting firm Deloitte put it during the COVID-19 pandemic: When a company has good relationships with its providers, those providers can usefully be thought of as almost like external departments of the company itself. <cite> See Jim Kilpatrick, Jennifer Brown, Ryan Flynn, Aaron Addicoat, and Pierre Mitchell, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/operations/chief-procurement-officer-cpo-survey.html">Deloitte Global 2021 Chief Procurement Officer Survey</a> (deloitte.com). </cite>
</p>

<p>
So, when drafting a contract, lawyers for both vendors and customers can do their clients a service by keeping those long-term business goals in mind.

Without a strong working relationship between the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association, the bubble could have popped before it got off the ground or as soon as the players came to terms with being physically trapped in Disney World.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-28-43-1">
<p>
If you haven't already, take a look at the "Hill of Proof" diagram for representations and warranties, at  <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>, reproduced here for convenience:
</p>


<p>
The noun <i>warranty</i> and the verb <i>warrant</i> can be thought of as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a statement of past, present, or future fact,</li>

<li>made by a party (the "<i>warranting party</i>"),</li>

<li>that a specified state of affairs exists, or existed, or will exist,</li>

<li>at or during a specified time — normally, the time at which the warranting party formally assents to the document containing the warranty;</li>

<li><b>where the warranting party promises</b> that <span class="underline">if</span> the warranted statement is shown to be (or have been) untrue, THEN — <b>regardless</b> whether the warranting party was or was not at fault for the untruth — 

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the warranting party will take one or more actions clearly specified in the contract — if any; or</li>

<li>if the contract <b>doesn't</b> specify such actions, <b>then</b> the warranting party will reimburse the warranty beneficiary (or -beneficiaries) for the <i>foreseeable</i>, <i>ordinary-course</i>, <i>economic</i> losses that are incurred by the warranty beneficiary as a result of the untruth of the warranted statement. <cite> This "foreseeable, ordinary-course economic losses" phrase draws on the well-known English case of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i>, discussed in the commentary to Protocol <a href="#r-conseq-dam-excl">23.5</a>. </cite></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>
Like a [BROKEN LINK: rep-defn], a warranty is a particular type of statement that, if false, can lead to liability — but the resemblance largely ends there, because a warranty has a different legal effect than a mere representation (as explained in more detail at <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">18.2</a>).

<p>
Under the law, a party might be deemed to have made <i>implied</i> warranties. Example: If Fred sells his car to Ginger without clearly saying otherwise, then the chances are extremely high that Fred will be deemed to have implicitly warranted to Ginger that yes, he does <i>own</i> the car (that is, he's not purporting to sell someone else's car).

At bottom, a warranty is a particular type of covenant, specifically, a <i>conditional</i> covenant.

<p>
As seen on the <i>right</i> side of the Hill of Proof (<a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>), if Fred sues Ginger for <i>breach of warranty</i>, he needn't show that he reasonably relied on Ginger's warranty — nor that Ginger acted negligently, recklessly, or deceptively — but simply that:
</p>

<p>
1.  Ginger made a warranty;
</p>

<p>
2.  a warranted fact proved untrue, and

3.  Fred suffered damages as a result.

EXAMPLE: A leading case on point is <i>CBS v. Ziff-Davis</i>, from the Court of Appeals of New York (that state's highest court), which in essence characterized a warranty as akin to an insurance policy, a contractual commitment to assume certain risks: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[A warranty is] <i>an assurance</i> by one party to a contract of the existence of a fact upon which <i>the other party may rely</i>. It is intended precisely to relieve the promisee of any duty to ascertain the fact for himself. It amounts to <i>a promise to indemnify the promisee</i> for any loss if the fact warranted proves untrue &#x2026;. <cite> <a href="http://law.wustl.edu/courses/lehrer/spring2006/CourseMat/2006/CBS-Ziff553_N_E_2d_997.pdf">CBS, Inc. v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-breach-warr-v-k">
<p>
The Fifth Circuit explained the difference between a breach of contract and a breach of warranty (under the Texas version of article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Breach of contract and warranty claims are distinct causes of action under Texas law and provide for different remedies, and <b>Texas law forbids conflating</b> breach of <i>warranty</i> and breach of <i>contract</i>. 
</p>

<p>
A breach of <i>contract</i> claim exists when a party <i>fails to deliver</i> the goods as promised. Damages are only permitted under a breach of contract cause of action when [i] the seller has failed to deliver the goods, [ii] the buyer has rejected the goods, or [iii] the buyer has revoked his acceptance.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Texas law allows a buyer to revoke acceptance of a good if the good was accepted without knowledge of the nonconformity and `acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller's assurance.</li>

<li>If a buyer retains and uses, alters, or changes the goods, it will be found to have accepted them. &#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
[A] breach of <i>warranty</i> claim &#x2026; arises when a seller delivers <i>nonconforming</i> goods. 
</p>

<p>
The UCC recognizes that breach of contract and breach of warranty are not the same cause of action. 
</p>

<p>
The remedies for breach of contract are set forth in Texas Business and Commerce Code section 2.711, and are available to a buyer where the seller fails to make delivery. 
</p>

<p>
The remedies for breach of warranty, however, are set forth in section 2.714, and are available to a buyer who has finally accepted goods, but discovers the goods are defective in some manner. Thus, <i>the critical factor</i> in whether the buyer has a breach of <i>contract</i> or breach of <i>warranty</i> claim is whether the buyer has finally accepted the goods. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7906662300642837887">Baker Hughes Process & Pipeline v. UE Compression, L.L.C.</a>, 938 F.3d 661, 666-67 (5th Cir. 2019) (affirming summary judgment dismissing Baker Hughes's claims) (formatting revised). </cite>

<h4 id="nl-WarrCmtPipes"><span class="section-number-4">28.43.6.</span> Pro tip: Be careful just <i>what</i> you warrant</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-WarrCmtPipes">
<p>
Recall that a warranty is in effect an insurance policy against the occurrence of a future event — <i>even if the future event is someone else's fault</i>. In a British Columbia case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A supplier sold water pipes to a customer for use in a construction project designed by the customer. The pipes conformed to the customer's specifications — in other words, the supplier delivered what the customer ordered. But <i>flaws in the customer's design</i> led to problems.</li>

<li>The contract's warranty language stated that the <i>supplier</i> warranted that the pipes were "free from all defects arising at any time <i>from faulty design</i>" (emphasis added).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The trial court ruled in favor of the supplier because the design problem was the customer's fault — but the appeals court reversed, holding that the supplier was liable because of its warranty, saying: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
[24] North American was obliged to deliver pipe in accordance with the appellant’s specifications.  North American agreed to do so.  
</p>

<p>
Quite separately, it warranted and guaranteed <i>[sic]</i> that if it so supplied the pipe, it <i>[sic; the pipe]</i> would be free of defects arising from faulty design.  <i>These are separate contractual obligations</i>.  The fact that a conflict may arise in practice does not render them any the less so.  
</p>

<p>
The warranty and guarantee provisions reflect a distribution of risk. 
</p>

<p>
* * * 
</p>

<p>
[34] Clauses such as 4.4.4 distribute risk.  Sometime they appear to do so unfairly, <i>but that is a matter for the marketplace, not for the courts</i>.  
</p>

<p>
There is a danger attached to such clauses. Contractors may refuse to bid or, if they do so, may build in costly contingencies. Those who do not protect themselves from unknown potential risk may pay dearly. &#x2026; Parties to construction or supply contracts may find it in their best interests to address more practically the assumption of design risk. To fail do to so merely creates the potential for protracted and costly litigation. <cite> <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2012/2012bcca337/2012bcca337.html">Greater Vancouver Water Dist. v. North American Pipe & Steel Ltd.</a>, 2012 BCCA 337, ¶ 24, 32 (CanLII) (extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
BUT: In 2021, Texas enacted legislation for real-estate construction and repair work that — with certain exceptions — could immunize contractors from liability for damage caused by defects in designs provided by others, effectively codifying what's known as the <i>Spearin</i> doctrine. <cite> See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code ch. 59, codifying <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB219/2021">S.B.219</a>; see also the discussion of the <i>Spearin</i> doctrine by Rose Tanner and Paul Sonderegger, <a href="https://www.thompsoncoburn.com/insights/publications/item/2022-05-31/project-owners-can-effectively-combat-contractors-efforts-to-use-the-spearin-doctrine-as-a-sword-with-strategic-planning-beforehand">Project owners can effectively combat contractors’ efforts to use the Spearin Doctrine as a sword with strategic planning beforehand</a> (ThompsonCoburn.com 2022), <i>archived at</i> <a href="https://perma.cc/H8SH-YRXR">https://perma.cc/H8SH-YRXR</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
As a Texas lawyer pointed out: "Chapter 59 expressly provides that it cannot be waived. Thus, any attempt by contractors and owners to contractually agree to waive the provisions of Chapter 59 will be void." <cite> Megan Healy Schmid, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/texas-contractors-no-longer-bear-risk-4709260">Texas Contractors No Longer Bear Risk for Defects in Owner-Furnished Designs</a> (JDSupra.com Mar. 9, 2022). </cite>

<h4 id="nl-warr-benef"><span class="section-number-4">28.43.7.</span> Who can benefit from a warranty in a contract?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-warr-benef">
<p>
Generally, if a contract warranty does not clearly identify its beneficiaries, the warranty <i>should</i> benefit only the other party (or if more than one, all other <i>relevant</i> parties) to the contract.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, if a warranty <i>does</i> clearly identify its beneficiaries, then the warranty <i>should</i> normally benefit only those specific individuals and organizations so identified (absent overriding provisions of law in the jurisdiction).
</p>

<p>
The usual rules governing claims of third-party-beneficiary status would presumably apply; see generally the commentary at <a href="#r-third-ben">2.11</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> A warranting party ABC that wants to limit the potential beneficiaries should consider using language such as, "ABC warrants <i>to XYZ</i> that &#x2026;."
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> A party that wanted its own affiliates, etc., to benefit from a warranty should make that clear in the warranty language itself. Here's a hypothetical example: "ABC warrants <i>to XYZ and XYZ's Affiliates</i> that &#x2026;."

<h4 id="nl-warr-present-vs-future"><span class="section-number-4">28.43.8.</span> Warranting a <i>present</i> or <i>future</i> fact? (It might matter.)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-warr-present-vs-future">
<p>
Drafters of representations and warranties should be careful to be clear just what is being represented warranted: Is it a <i>present</i> fact, or is it a <i>future</i> fact? The distinction can be important because in many jurisdictions: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The "clock" for the statute of limitations will not start to tick for a warranty of <i>future performance</i> (for example, a warranty that a car will not have any mechanical problems for X years or Y miles) until the warranty failure is <i>discovered</i>;
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  In contrast, for a warranty of <i>present fact</i> — for example, that goods <i>as delivered</i> are free from defects — the clock starts ticking <i>at delivery</i>.
</p>

<p>
For example, in its 2019 <i>Kenworth of Indianapolis</i> opinion, Indiana's supreme court noted that:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
Under the UCC, a party's cause of action accrues (thus triggering the limitations period) upon delivery of goods. 
</p>

<p>
However, if a warranty explicitly guarantees the quality or performance standards of the goods for a specific future time period, the cause of action accrues when the aggrieved party discovers (or should have discovered) the breach. This is known as the future-performance exception. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14165085228410759383">Kenworth of Indianapolis, Inc., v. Seventy-Seven Ltd.</a>, 134 N.E.3d 370, 374 (Ind. 2019) (extra paragraphing added). </cite>e
</p>

<p>
And in its 2015 <i>ACE Securities</i> opinion — rejecting a claim that a contract had validly extended the statutory limitation period — New York's highest court distinguished cases in which <i>future performance</i> was warranted. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=52415138628671678">ACE Securities Corp. v.

<p>
Some states do not allow companies to sell consumer products "as is"; in those states, sellers have implied-warranty obligations that cannot be avoided. And the federal <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law">Magnuson-Moss Act</a> prohibits a company from disclaiming <i>implied</i> warranties (see <a href="#impl-warr-goods">18.1.6.1</a>) for any consumer product <b>if</b> the company offers a <i>written</i> warranty for the product <b>or</b> sells a service contract for it.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-warr-defn-top">
<p>
Drafters should consider the following issues:
</p>

<p>
1.  What <i>exact</i> past, present, or future fact will a party "warrant"?
</p>

<p>
2.  Would the warranting party prefer to make a <i>representation</i> about the warranted fact instead of a warranty? See <a href="#RelDisclBkgd">22.34.6.7</a> for discussion.
</p>

<p>
(BUT: The party that is to benefit from the warranty will <i>always</i> prefer that the warranting party do both: Represent, <i>and</i> warrant.)
</p>

<p>
3.  Will the warranting party be warranting — 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a <i>present</i> fact (for example, when a seller warrants the condition of goods <i>as delivered</i>)?</li>

<li>a <i>future</i> fact (e.g., when a seller warrants that goods will perform in a certain way for a stated period of time)?  This can make a difference for when the statute of limitations begins to run for a claim of breach of warranty, as discussed at <a href="#nl-warr-present-vs-future">28.43.8</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
4.  What exactly does the warranting party commit to <i>do</i> if a warranted fact turns out not to be true — anything specific, such as the Three Rs? (Repair, Replace, or Refund)?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the contract is silent on that point, then the warranting party would liable in damages for any breach of the warranty.</li>
</ul>

<p>
5.  Are there any <i>time</i> limits to the warranting party's obligation? For example: Warranty issues must be reported to the warranting party within X days after delivery.
</p>

<p>
6.  Are there any <i>monetary</i> limits to the warranting party's obligation? For example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Cap:</i> The warranting party will not be liable for more than $XXX if a warranted fact turns out to be untrue; or</li>

<li><i>Basket:</i> The warranting party will not be liable for breach of warranty until the resulting damages exceeds $XXX, (<a href="#nl-liab-basket">28.4</a>) at which point:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Deductible basket:</i> The warranting party will be liable only for damages in excess of that amount (known as a "deductible basket"); or</li>

<li><i>Tipping-</i> or <i>first-dollar basket:</i> The warranting party will be liable for <i>all</i> damages after the specified amount has been reached.</li>

<p>
Let's illustrate the subcontractor concept with a simple  example. Suppose that a would-be homeowner buys an old house (a "tear-down") in a desirable neighborhood and wants to put up a new house on the site. After obtaining architectural plans:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The owner will typically hire a prime contractor, which is commonly referred to as the general contractor, or "GC," to actually get the house built.</li>

<li>The general contractor will in turn engage various other companies such as: • a demo company to demolish the old house and clear the site; • a foundation company to pour a new foundation; • a framing company to erect the frame of the house; • a roofing company; etc.</li>

<li>Each of these other companies is referred to as a subcontractor or "sub"; the subs will normally deal only with the general contractor and not with the owner.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-28-46-3">
<p>
From an article by New York attorney Bradley Pollina:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The typical arrangement on most construction projects is that the property owner or developer engages the services of a general contractor or construction manager, which in turn subcontracts the work out to the various trades pursuant to a number of subcontracts.  
</p>

<p>
Under this standard arrangement, subcontractors seeking payment for their work are generally limited to recovering funds from the general contractor or construction manager, as that is the party they contracted with.  
</p>

<p>
Generally, under such an arrangement, <b>there is no basis for an unpaid subcontractor to sue the property owner</b> or developer for nonpayment because there is no contract between them. 
</p>

<p>
(The obvious exception is a <b>mechanic’s lien</b> foreclosure action, where unpaid subcontractors, among others, can directly pursue a claim against the real property at issue, even where they do not have a contract with the owner.)

Wage theft, where companies fail to pay their low-wage employees what they're owed, is by no means unheard of.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-legal-compl-addl-cmt">
<p>
A customer that engages a contractor should keep in mind that the law might make the <i>customer</i> responsible for the contractor's or subcontractor's failure to pay employee wages. For example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=2810.3.&lawCode=LAB">California Labor Code § 2810.3</a> makes certain <i>business</i> customers liable, as a matter of law, for unpaid wages and worker's compensation coverage of their contractors' non-exempt employees.</li>
</ul>

<p>
See generally Todd Lebowitz, <a href="http://www.employmentlawspotlight.com/2014/11/new-california-law-imposes-joint-liability-on-businesses-and-contract-vendors-for-wage-violations-and-workers-compensation-coverage/">New California Law Imposes Joint Liability on Businesses and Contract Vendors &#x2026;</a> (EmploymentLawSpotlight.com Nov. 10, 2014).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=2810.">California Labor Code § 2810</a> prohibits both business- and personal customers from entering into labor- or service contracts "with a construction, farm labor, garment, janitorial, security guard, or warehouse contractor, <i>where the person or entity knows <b>or should know</b> that the contract or agreement does not include funds sufficient</i> to allow the contractor to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws or regulations governing the labor or services to be provided."</li>
</ul>

<p>
Under subdivision g of section 2810, a customer that violates this prohibition is liable to any contractor employees who are injured by a violation of law or regulation. (Other subdivisions contain certain exceptions, including for residential construction work, as well as certain rebuttable presumptions if the contract documentation conforms to particular standards.)
</p>

<p>
Customers might therefore want their contractors and subcontractors, at all levels, to put payment-security arrangements in place; see <a href="#r-pmt-sec-addl">9.2</a>: <i>Backup Payment Source Protocol</i> and its commentary.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ambig-wha">
<p>
Courts are pretty much agreed that a contract term is <i>ambiguous</i> if it is susceptible to <b>two or more <i>reasonable</i> interpretations</b> that can't be resolved by the usual tools of interpretation (known as "canons of construction," discussed at <a href="#ambig-interpr">29.7</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
[A] contract is ambiguous only when the application of pertinent rules of interpretation to the face of the instrument leaves it <i>genuinely uncertain</i> which one of two or more meanings is the proper meaning&#x2026;. 
</p>

<p>
In other words, if <b>after</b> applying established rules of interpretation to the contract it remains reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning it is ambiguous, <b>but</b> if only one reasonable meaning <i>clearly emerges</i> it is not ambiguous. <b>The interpreting court must decide</b>[: (1)] whether the meaning of the text <b>read in context</b> is genuinely uncertain or [(2)] whether one reasonable meaning clearly emerges. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4585972211868751788">Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Tex.

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b> The term "<b>consummated</b>" sales led to what must have been a costly lawsuit over a finder's fee for helping land a federal contract: A court ruled that the finder's-fee agreement did not require the resulting federal contract to be "performed" during a particular time period in order for the transaction to be "consummated" — instead, the fact that that the contract was <i>signed</i> during the relevant time period was enough, and so the finder's fee was therefore due and owing. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7179354725729935348">Fed Cetera, LLC v.

</p>

<p>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b> Honeywell sued an electronics company over royalties owed under a patent-license agreement. The agreement allowed Honeywell to conduct an audit, <b>but</b> the audit had to be "<b>conducted</b>" within one year of the "Effective Date" of the agreement. A district court held that "the audit performed here occurred, in whole or in part, outside the one-year period." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12699347891664566748">Honeywell Int'l, Inc. v.

<p>
<b>12 midnight:</b> Suppose that our fictional client MathWhiz (<a href="#hypo-facts">34.8.3</a>) has signed a lease for office space, where it is the tenant. And suppose also that the lease says the following:
</p>

<div class="alt" id="org1383bfe">
<p>
Tenant will vacate the Premises no later than <b>12 midnight on December 15</b>; Tenant's failure to do so will be a material breach of this Agreement.
</p>

</div>

<p>
(Bold-faced emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
Now suppose that a MathWhiz representative calls you up and says that they can't move out before <b>10:00 a.m.</b> on December 15.  
</p>

<p>
QUESTION At <i>that</i> time, on <i>that</i> day: &bull; Would MathWhiz still have 14 hours left in which to finish moving out? &bull; Or would MathWhiz already in material breach because it didn't move out by the <i>previous</i> midnight?  In other words: Does "by midnight" mean before midnight at the <i>start</i> of the day, or before midnight at the <i>end</i> of the day? 
</p>

<p>
Ripple-effect business complications can arise from such potential ambiguities — in the December 15 example above, the landlord might have already re-leased the premises to a new tenant, with a promise that the new tenant can move in on that date.
</p>

<p>
This illustrates a useful drafting principle: <b>W.I.D.D. – When In Doubt, <i>Define</i>!</b> (see <a href="#widd">29.9.3</a>). We could do that by being more explicit about <i>12 midnight</i>, as is done at Protocol <a href="#channel-offg">15.15.2</a> (stating when a "Partnership Term" ends). 
</p>

<p>
QUESTION: How would you rewrite the "Tenant will vacate the Premises no later than 12 midnight <b>on</b> December 15 &#x2026;." sentence to resolve this ambiguity?
</p>


<p>
<b>"Within X days of Y":</b> Does that mean <i>before</i> Y, or <i>after</i>? From the NY Times, about improvements in training junior doctors to intubate infants:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ntubation is a delicate procedure requiring the insertion of a breathing tube into a trachea or windpipe. * * * We randomized these trainees into two groups. The first group received supervision from senior clinicians while intubating infants, which is routine. The second group — the “coaching” arm of the trial — also received supervision while intubating infants, but <b>in addition, they got targeted coaching</b> by a senior clinician <b>within an hour of</b> that intubation. <cite> Stephen G. Flynn, Raymond S. Park, Pete G. Kovatsis, and Anupam B. Jena, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/opinion/doctors-warm-up.html?unlocked_article_code=1.nE4.UlWx.CmKdbl5HvJ60&smid=url-share">The Hack Doctors Should Take From Pop Stars and Quarterbacks</a> (NYTimes.com 2025) (formatting edited). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
QUESTION: Did this additional "targeted coaching" occur within the hour <i>before</i> intubation, or within the hour <i>after</i> it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lesson:</b> Better to say, "within an hour <i>before</i> (or <i>after</i>) &#x2026;." 
</p>

<p>
(DCT note: I intentionally left out the next sentence from the quote: "<b>This warm-up</b> took only five to 10 minutes and involved the trainee reviewing <b>and practicing</b> on an infant manikin the steps required to intubate a baby safely" — does that clarify the meaning?)

<p>
EXAMPLE: From <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/my-friend-is-getting-divorced-her-husband-says-take-the-house-is-there-a-catch-ca7ababc">a newspaper advice column</a> responding to a question about a property settlement in a divorce: "Maryland and Florida are not community-property states, meaning <i>the assets may not be distributed 50/50</i> &#x2026;." QUESTION: Does this mean those states <i>prohibit</i> 50-50 distributions? (Spoiler: No.) 
</p>

<p>
To avoid possible confusion:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use <i>may</i> to indicate permission: <i>ABC may delay payment until December 31</i>.</li>
<li>Use <i>might</i> to indicate possibility: <i>It might rain tomorrow</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This can be summarized in the acronym <i>MPMP</i>: May for Permission, Might for Possibility.

<h4 id="oblig-pty"><span class="section-number-4">29.2.3.</span> Party obligations, reps, warranties: Who's accountable?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-oblig-pty">
<p>
To place accountability where it belongs, obligations, warranties, and representations should be phrased so that they're made by <b>individual parties</b>, not by multiple parties jointly — use <b>each party</b> when appropriate.
</p>

<p>
Let's use <i>representations</i> as an illustrative example:
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="orgc00254d">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     <b>Both Parties represent</b> that <b>they are not</b> subject to any exclusion order barring <b>them</b> from federal-government contracts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>     <b>Each Party represents</b> that <b>it is not</b> subject to any exclusion order barring <span class="underline">it</span> from federal-government contracts.
</p>

</div>

<p>
The problem: In the first example above, conceivably the "<i>Both parties represent</i>" phrasing could provide an opening for an aggressive lawyer to claim that the doctrine of "<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mutual_material_mistake">mutual mistake</a>" supposedly excused a misrepresentation.  The claim might not succeed — but let's (try to) not leave any openings for that sort of tactic.
</p>

<p>
(It might be another story if two parties were to be jointly and severally liable to a third party for something.)

<h3 id="ambig-why-bad"><span class="section-number-3">29.3.</span> Why ambiguity is (usually) a <i>bad</i> thing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ambig-why-bad">
<p>
If a potential ambiguity comes to light <i>after</i> a contract is signed, each party might have new, <i>self-interested</i> reasons — such as changed circumstances, or different people calling the shots — to argue for interpreting the provision in a way that disadvantages the other party. That in turn can lead to disputes and even lawsuits.
</p>

<p>
And there might well be a lot of money riding on whether a court concludes that a contract term is or isn't ambiguous.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Plains Exploration</i> (Tex. 2015), the losing party ultimately missed out recovering the roughly <i>$44 million</i> that it had claimed it was owed under the contract in suit, because the state's supreme court concluded that the relevant contract language unambiguously ruled out the losing party's claim. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5783396131819448341">Plains Explor. & Prod.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: As discussed in the comments to Protocol <a href="#after-defn">22.2</a>, in <i>Apache Corp.</i> (Tex. 2023), a lawsuit over the meaning of the word "from" resulted in a party not being entitled to some <i>$180 million</i>. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18122647652832467618">Apache Corp. v. Apollo Exploration, LLC</a>, 670 S.W.3d 319, 321 (Tex. 2023) (reversing and remanding court of appeals). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Dahua Tech.</i> (1st Cir. 2025), an employee's severance agreement with his company called for the company to pay the employee "monthly severance payments &#x2026; in the amount of $680,000 for sixteen (16) <i>[sic]</i> months &#x2026;." 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After much litigation, culminating in an 11-day (!) bench trial, a federal trial court in Massachusetts held that this called for <i>each monthly payment</i> to be $680,000; rejecting the company's request to reform the contract on grounds of mutual mistake, the trial court entered judgment for the employee in the amount of $10,200,000, plus prejudgment interest.</li>
<li>The First Circuit, though, concl</li>
</ul>
<p>
uded that "the inartfully drafted severance provision [was] ambiguous" and that "[i]n our view, the Release Agreement made no such unambiguous promise"; the court remanded the case to the trial court to resolve the ambiguity on the basis of extrinsic evidence. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6326888176289587666">Dahua Tech. USA, Inc. v. Zhang</a>, 138 F.4th 1, 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2025). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Offshore Drilling</i> (5th Cir. 2010), an off-shore drilling rig was severely damaged by fire while in drydock in Galveston for maintenance:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The drilling rig's owner and the drydock owner disputed which of the two parties had had "control" of the rig at the time of the fire.</li>
<li>The intended meaning of "control" was important because under the parties' agreement, if the drilling rig's owner had control at the time of the fire, then the drydock owner was not financially responsible for the fire damage.</li>
<li>Needless to say, the meaning of "control" was hotly contested (as it were &#x2026;).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The trial court held that the term "control" was unambiguous, and granted summary judgment that, <i>on the undisputed facts</i>, the rig owner, not the dock owner, had been in control at the time of the fire. The appeals court affirmed; thus, the parties were spared the expense, inconvenience, and uncertainty of a trial on the issue of control of the rig. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14794871969741142487">Offshore Drilling Co. v. Gulf Copper & Mfg. Corp.</a>, 604 F.3d 221 (5th Cir. 2010) (affirming summary judgment in relevant part). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Of course, the drilling-rig owner would certainly have preferred to go to trial and take its chances with a jury, versus losing on summary judgment before the trial even started.
</p>

<p>
But for the drydock owner, <i>not</i> having to go to trial was most assuredly a win.

<p>
As one type of potential ambiguity, <b>a term is <i>vague</i> if its <i>precise</i> meaning is uncertain</b>. 
</p>

<p>
A classic example is the term <i>tall</i>: If you say that someone is tall, you could be referring to that a third-grader who is tall <i>for his- or her age</i> but is still very-much shorter than the general adult population.
</p>

<p>
Another classic example of vagueness is the word <i>cool</i>; depending on the season and the locale, the term could refer to a wide range of temperatures. For example, suppose that, at 2 p.m. on an August day, the temperature is 80ºF: &bull; In Houston, it'd be unseasonably cool (compared to our usual temperatures then). &bull; In Point Barrow, Alaska, the locals would likely think 80ºF was a real scorcher. Similarly, a parent could feel an ailing child's forehead and report that the skin was cool, which would probably mean around 98ºF; this would have a different meaning than urging the child to wear a sweater because it was cool outside, probably around 60ºF or so.

<h4 id="orge2b752d"><span class="section-number-4">29.5.2.</span> A term could be both vague <i>and</i> have multiple meanings</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-29-5-2">
<p>
In English-speaking families with teens or tweens at home, parents know that the word <i>cool</i> can have multiple meanings: Apart from the above temperature example, <i>cool</i> could be used to indicate approval — or scorn.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at another example, this time a silly one. Consider the following provision in a contract for a home caregiver:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Nurse will visit Patient's house each day, check her vital signs, and give her cat food.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The sentence above could conceivably take on any of three meanings:
</p>

<p>
1.  Nurse is to put a bowl of food down for Patient's cat each day.
</p>

<p>
2.  Nurse is to <i>deliver</i> cat food to Patient when Nurse visits.
</p>

<p>
3.  Nurse is to <i>feed</i> cat food to Patient. <i>(OK</i>, that <i>one might be a stretch.)</i>
</p>

<p>
In addition, the sentence above might also be <i>vague</i> if it turned out that Patient had more than one cat.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, meanings #1 and #2 above are vague in another sense as well: The term <i>cat food</i> encompasses wet food, dry food, etc.
</p>

<h4 id="vague-fix"><span class="section-number-4">29.5.3.</span> Is vagueness worth fixing?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-vague-fix">
<p>
<b>Vagueness is not necessarily a bad thing.</b> Parties might be confident that, if a question ever arises, it'll be clear (or can be expeditiously determined) just what was intended by, say, the term <i>reasonable efforts</i>, and so it wouldn't be the best use of time to try to agree on a precise definition of what was and wasn't required.
</p>

<p>
Analogously: In response to comments made about proposed financial-disclosure requirements, in 1969 the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to get more specific about the meaning of the term <i>line of business</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[I]n view of the numerous ways in which companies are organized to do business, the variety of products and services, the history of predecessor and acquired companies, and the diversity of operating characteristics, such as markets, raw materials, manufacturing processes and competitive conditions, <b>it is not deemed feasible or desirable to be more specific</b> in defining a line of business. 
</p>

<p>
Management, because of its familiarity with company structure, is in the most informed position to separate the company into components <b>on a reasonable basis</b> for reporting purposes.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, <b>discretion is left to the management</b> to devise a reporting pattern appropriate to the particular company's operations and responsive to its organizational concepts.

<h3 id="ambig-interpr"><span class="section-number-3">29.7.</span> Resolving ambiguity (step 1): Canons of construction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ambig-interpr">
<p>
Sometimes parties to a contract will dispute the meaning of a contract provision. In the U.S., if the dispute goes to court, the trial judge uses a one- or possibly-two step process in resolving the dispute. This section discusses the first step;  <a href="#ambig-constr-step2">29.8</a> addresses the second step, which might or might not be needed.
</p>

<p>
The trial judge makes the first pass at determining the meaning of a disputed provision, using the usual rules of contract interpretation (see below). The goal is to see if the case can be decided <i>quickly</i> (and thus less expensively), via a party's motion to dismiss on the pleadings or a motion for summary judgment. 
</p>

<p>
If the trial judge concludes that this first-pass review has produced a definite meaning for the disputed provision, then the judge will <i>declare</i> that meaning. This means that there won't be the need for a trial to establish the meaning of that particular provision. But conceivably the appellate court might have a different view about the provision's proper interpretation: The appeals court might conclude that the provision is indeed ambiguous, in which case the appeals court might well send the case back to the lower court for a trial to determine the provision's meaning.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Plains Exploration</i> (Tex. 2015), the Texas supreme court recapped some of the general ground rules — sometimes known as the "canons of construction" — for how this works; to better <a href="#serv-rdr">Serve The Reader</a>, I've recast the court's discussion into short, single-subject paragraphs:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Absent ambiguity</b>, contracts are construed as a matter of law. <br>
<i>[DCT comment: That is, it's the trial judge — not the jury — who construes the contract, <b>but</b> the appeals court is free to overrule the trial judge]</i>.
</p>

<p>
In construing a written contract, <b>our primary objective</b> is to ascertain the parties' true intentions as expressed in the language they chose. 
</p>

<p>
We construe contracts from a utilitarian standpoint bearing in mind <b>the particular business activity</b> sought to be served, and <b>avoiding unreasonable constructions</b> when possible and proper. 
</p>

<p>
To that end, we consider <b>the entire writing</b> and giving effect to all the contract provisions so that <b>none will be rendered meaningless</b>.
</p>

<p>
No single provision taken alone is given controlling effect; rather, each must be considered <b>in the context</b> of the instrument as a whole. 
</p>

<p>
We also give words their plain, common, or <b>generally accepted meaning</b> unless the contract shows that the parties used words in a technical or different sense.
</p>

<p>
While <b>extrinsic evidence</b> of the parties' intent is <b>not</b> admissible to <b>create</b> an ambiguity, the contract <b>may be read</b> in light of the circumstances surrounding its execution to determine <b>whether</b> an ambiguity exists. 
</p>

<p>
Consideration of the surrounding facts and circumstances is <b>simply an aid</b> in the construction of the contract's language and <b>has its limits</b>. The rule that extrinsic evidence is not admissible to create an ambiguity obtains <b>even to the extent of prohibiting</b> proof of circumstances surrounding the transaction <b>when</b> the instrument involved, by its terms, <i>plainly and clearly discloses the intention of the parties</i>, or is so worded that <i>it is not fairly susceptible of more than one legal meaning</i> or construction. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5783396131819448341">Plains Explor. & Prod.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-exp-unius">
<p>
When interpreting contract language, courts sometimes resort to a principle summarized by the Latin phrase <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>, which can be translated as, <b>to express one thing is to exclude others</b>. 
</p>

<p>
In <i>Wells Fargo</i> (2d Cir. 2018), the court provided an example: "By <i>expressly foreclosing</i> certain proceedings from arbitration, the parties in these cases <i>strongly implied</i> that <i>every other</i> controversy or dispute <i>remains</i> subject to arbitral resolution." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9470365712805598589">Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC v. Sappington</a>, 884 F. 3d 392, 396 (2d Cir. 2018) (affirming denial of Wells Fargo's petition to compel individual arbitration instead of class arbitration) (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The same principle is sometimes used in interpreting statutes and regulations. In <i>John Wiley & Sons</i> (2d Cir. 2018), the same appeals court elaborated:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; the interpretive canon of <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> instructs that Congress's expression of one or several items in an enumerated list typically reflects an intent to exclude another left unmentioned. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the Copyright Act, Congress <b>expressly provided</b> a cause of action for infringement only for legal or beneficial owners of one of the six enumerated exclusive rights under a copyright.</li>

<li>The right to sue is <b>conspicuously absent from the list</b> of exclusive rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>
[Thus, the] plain language of the Act does not authorize infringement actions by mere assignees of the bare right to sue &#x2026;. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16973357464636395674">John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. DRK Photo</a>, 882 F. 3d 394, 405 (2d Cir. 2018) (affirming summary judgment) (formatting modified). </cite>e
</p>


<p>
Likewise, in <i>Trump</i> (D.C. Cir. 2024), the court of appeals used what amounts to the same principle (minus the Latin) in affirming rejection of former President Trump's claim of immunity from prosecution for alleged crimes committed while he was in office: 
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote &#x2026; <b>The Framers knew how</b> to explicitly grant criminal immunity in the Constitution, as they did to legislators in the Speech or Debate Clause. <b>Yet they chose not</b> to include a similar provision granting immunity to the President. &#x2026; <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16165747709502006755">United States v. Trump</a>, 91 F.4th 1173, 1201 (D.C. Cir.)

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Famously, of course, in <i>Trump</i> the Supreme Court took a very-different view of the merits of the presidential-immunity issue: The Court's majority did not address the D.C. Circuit's "the Framers knew how" reasoning, while in contrast Justice Sotomayor largely based her dissent on that reasoning. <cite> See 144 S. Ct. at 2357, part III.A (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). </cite>

<h4 id="ejus"><span class="section-number-4">29.7.3.</span> <i>Ejusdem generis</i> and <i>noscitur a sociis</i>: Known by the company they keep</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-ejus">
<p>
Courts sometimes look to a principle of interpreting language that's referred to as <i>ejusdem generis</i> ("eh-USE-dem GENerous"). As one online legal dictionary explains, "if a law refers to automobiles, trucks, tractors, motorcycles, and other motor-powered vehicles, a court might use <i>ejusdem generis</i> to hold that such vehicles would not include airplanes, because the list included only land-based transportation." <cite> <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ejusdem_generis">Nolo’s Plain-English Law Dictionary</a> (law.cornell.edu). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Contract drafters can avoid application of <i>ejusdem generis</i> to contract language by using the term "including <i>but not limited to</i>" (emphasis added), <b>or</b> by simply <i>defining</i> "including" in that way, as then-Judge Alito pointed out in a Third Circuit decision: "By using the phrase 'including, but not limited to,' the parties unambiguously stated that the list was <i>not</i> exhaustive &#x2026;. [and so] the doctrine of <i>ejusdem generis</i> is inapplicable." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8996416977952349564">Cooper Distributing Co.</a>, 63 F.3d at 280 (3d Cir. 1995) (Alito, J.; citations omitted, formatting edited); see also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3220984568246729558">Eastern Air Lines</a>, 532 F.2d at 988-89 (5th Cir. 1976); <a href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/339_a5pzok3k.pdf">Scott & Triantis</a> at 850 & n.100 (2006) </cite>
</p>

<p>
Concerning <i>ejusdem generis</i>, the Supreme Court offered this in <i>Fisher</i> (2024):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
One way to discern the reach of an “otherwise” clause is to <b>look for guidance from whatever examples come before it</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Two general principles are relevant.
</p>

<p>
First, the canon of <i>noscitur a sociis</i> teaches that a word is given more precise content by <b>the neighboring words</b> with which it is associated. That avoids ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with the company it keeps.
</p>

<p>
And under the related canon of <i>ejusdem generis</i>, <b>a general or collective term at the end of a list of specific items</b> is typically controlled and defined by reference to the specific classes that precede it.
</p>

<p>
These approaches to statutory interpretation track the common sense intuition that Congress would not ordinarily introduce a general term that renders meaningless the specific text that accompanies it.
</p>

<p>
To see why, consider a straightforward example. A zoo might post a sign that reads, “do not pet, feed, yell or throw objects at the animals, or otherwise disturb them.”  If a visitor eats lunch in front of a hungry gorilla, or talks to a friend near its enclosure, has he obeyed the regulation? Surely yes. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although the smell of human food or the sound of voices might well disturb gorillas, the specific examples of impermissible conduct all involve direct interaction with and harassment of the zoo animals.</li>

<li>Merely eating or talking is so unlike the examples that the zoo provided that it would be implausible to assume those activities were prohibited, even if literally covered by the language.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The idea is simply that a general phrase can be given a more focused meaning by the terms linked to it. That principle ensures—regardless of how complicated a sentence might appear—that none of its specific parts are made re- dundant by a clause literally broad enough to include them. For instance, a football league might adopt a rule that players must not “grab, twist, or pull a facemask, helmet, or other equipment with the intent to injure a player, or otherwise attack, assault, or harm any player.” If a linebacker shouts insults at the quarterback and hurts his feelings, has the linebacker nonetheless followed the rule? Of course he has. The examples of prohibited actions all concern dangerous physical conduct that might inflict bodily harm; trash talk is simply not of that kind. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9255921977848812134">Fischer v. United States</a>, 603 U.S. 480, 144 S. Ct. 2176, 2183-84 (2024) (vacating and remanding D.C.

<h4 id="canon-other"><span class="section-number-4">29.7.4.</span> Other canons of construction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-canon-other">
<p>
In interpreting contract language, judges can look to still-more canons of construction:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <b>Specific terms</b> normally take precedence over general terms.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  A term stated <b>earlier</b> in a contract is given priority over later terms.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The rule of the <b>last antecedent</b> — for example: A federal criminal statute included a mandatory ten-year minimum sentence in cases where the defendant had previously been convicted of "aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward." Writing in <i>Lockhart</i> (U.S. 2016), a majority of the Supreme Court held that the minor-or-ward qualifier in the just-quoted provision applied only to abusive sexual conduct, not to sexual abuse; as a result, a defendant was subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence for sexual abuse against an adult. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2653433781763428483">Lockhart v. United States</a>, 577 U.S. 347, 136 S. Ct. 958, 962 (2016). </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  BUT: <b>The series-qualifier principle</b> might weigh against the rule of last antecedent. Dissenting in <i>Lockhart</i>, Justice Kagan argued: "Imagine a friend told you that she hoped to meet 'an actor, director, or producer involved with the new Star Wars movie.' You would know immediately that she wanted to meet an actor from the Star Wars cast—not an actor in, for example, the latest Zoolander." <cite> <i>Id.</i>, 136 S. Ct. at 969 (Kagan, J., dissenting). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ambig-constr-step2">
<p>
If applying the above canons of construction doesn't resolve the dispute, then the disputed provision is indeed ambiguous. When that happens, (in the U.S.) <i>the trial judge is not allowed to grant a quick judgment</i>:  Instead, the court must conduct a trial (if the parties are lucky, a trial on just that one issue) so that the "trier of fact" — a jury, or perhaps the judge him&#x2011; or herself — can evaluate the parties' evidence and make factual findings about the meaning of the disputed provision.   
</p>

<p>
Importantly: At least in U.S. jurisdictions, an appeals court isn't likely to overrule such a <i>factual</i> determination by a jury or a trial-court judge. The Seventh Circuit explained:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The district court's job was to look at extrinsic evidence and determine what the agreement was. It did that. 
</p>

<p>
Our job is to decide if the district court's view of that evidence was clearly erroneous (or legally wrong). &#x2026; The argument, '<i>The Borrowers' position was supported by the evidence presented at trial but our interpretation is way, way better</i>' is a nonstarter.

But don't go overboard — see #3 in Bryan Garner's <a href="https://lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-442-guidelines-for-legal-definitions">LawProse Lesson #442: Guidelines for Legal Definitions</a> (2024): "If you create a defined term, then <i>use</i> it. (You know how often this rule is broken.)"

<h4 id="ambig-negot"><span class="section-number-4">29.9.4.</span> But: Strategically, an ambiguity <i>might</i> be better left in place</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-ambig-negot">
<p>
The A.T.A.R.I. Rule (<a href="#atari-rule">29.9.2</a>) and W.I.D.D. (<a href="#widd">29.9.3</a>) are great rules of thumb — but neither of them is a hard-and-fast rule; a drafter should think strategically before deciding whether to revise a potentially-ambiguous contract term during negotiations.
</p>

<p>
&bull;   <i>Did</i> <b>your</b> <i>side draft the potentially-ambiguous language?</i> Then yes, <b>fix it</b> — especially if the draft hasn't yet been sent to the other side. That's because under the doctrine of <i>contra proferentem</i> (<a href="#r-contra-prof">14.1</a>), a court might resolve the question <i>in favor of the other side</i> because your side was responsible for the ambiguity.
</p>

<p>
&bull;   <i>Did</i> <b>the other side</b> <i>draft the potentially-ambiguous language?</i> If yes, then you might <i>not</i> want to say anything about it, in the hope that <i><a href="#r-contra-prof">contra proferentem</a></i> (<a href="#r-contra-prof">14.1</a>) would result in an interpretation favorable to your client.
</p>

<p>
If you didn't have the superior bargaining position, it might be especially tempting to keep mum about a potential ambiguity: If you were to "<a href="#poke-bear">poke the bear</a>" (<a href="#poke-bear">30.14</a>) — that is, call the other side's attention to the issue — then the other side might wake up and ask for something that's even worse for your client. (See <a href="#poke-bear">30.14</a> for examples.)
</p>

<p>
One study of contract forms recounted an email from a lawyer who worked in private-equity transactions:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are occasions where, if I had asked for clarity, I’d have gotten a clause that disadvantaged my client. In such a case, because the ambiguous language retained value for my client, I probably would not push for clarity. <cite> Tara Chowdhury, Faith Chudkowski, and Mitu Gulati, <a href="https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4783&context=umlr#page=8">The Form Knows Best</a>, 79 U. Mia. L. Rev. 607, 613 (2025) (quoting email; footnote omitted), available at <a href="https://repository.law.miami.edu/umlr/vol79/iss4/3">https://repository.law.miami.edu/umlr/vol79/iss4/3</a>. </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
BUT: Later, the other side might be able to show that you noticed, <i>but failed to raise</i>, an ambiguity created by the other side's drafter — and under those circumstances, the other side might try to argue that, because your client "laid behind the log," your client should be held to have <i>waived</i> any benefit that it might otherwise have accrued from the <i>contra proferentem</i> doctrine.
</p>

<p>
And pragmatically: If you <i>don’t</i> ask the other side to correct an ambiguity that they created, then you might be setting up your client for an expensive, burdensome, future fight — a fight that perhaps might have been avoided with clearer drafting — and it might have been better to have that fight <i>before</i> the contract is signed, while your client still had the option to walk away.
</p>

<p>
The <b>W.I.D.A.C. Rule</b> also applies here: <b>When In Doubt, Ask the Client</b> (and/or your supervising attorney), and be ready with a recommendation, including your reasons — also, be sure to confirm the decision with the client with a quick email. (See <a href="#partn-r">32.10</a> for more on this.)

<h3 id="ambig-balk"><span class="section-number-3">29.10.</span> What if The Other Side balks at fixing an ambiguity?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ambig-balk">
<p>
It's been known to happen that, during contract negotiations, <i>A</i> asks to rewrite an ambiguity, but <i>B</i>'s lawyer says, <i>there's no need to rewrite it, because the courts construe it the way you say</i>.
</p>

<p>
Is that good enough — should <i>A</i> just accept <i>B</i>'s assertion? <b>Very possibly not:</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In a dispute, <i>B</i>'s lawyers will argue (often shamelessly) for whatever interpretation seems good to them at the time — regardless of what was previously said by <i>B</i>.</li>

<li><i>A</i> will be reluctant to risk having a court hold that, by not insisting on clarifying the ambiguity, <i>A</i> waived its own preferred interpretation of the language.</li>

<li>On the other hand: <i><i>B</i></i> might be stuck with its prior assertion to <i>A</i>, on estoppel grounds or analogously to <i><a href="#r-contra-prof">contra proferentem</a></i> (see <a href="#r-contra-prof">14.1</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
This will ultimately come down to how <i>A</i>'s business people — advised by counsel — judge the overall business risk.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ambig-exer-q">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A contract term is ambiguous when the term is amenable to [BLANK].</li>

<li>In litigation, when a contract provision has multiple plausible meanings, and the parties' intended meaning can't be determined by conventional rules of interpretation, then that determination will be made by: A) the judge; B) the jury; C) one or more other officials.</li>

<li>Consider the following sentence: "Alice says that Bob is cold." Is this more likely to be considered <i>vague</i>, <i>ambiguous</i>, or both?</li>

<li>Consider the following sentence: "Alice says that Bob's forehead feels warm."  Is this more likely to be considered vague, ambiguous, or both?</li>

<li>What is a principal danger of an ambiguous contract term?</li>

<li>FACTS: In a contract draft prepared by The Other Side, you see a term that's vague — it says that Argon must pay The Other Side a certain amount by a certain date, but doesn't specify <i>the time of day</i> for that deadline. QUESTION: Is this worth asking The Other Side to fix? Discuss your reasoning.</li>

<li>MORE FACTS: In this contract, Argon is located in Vancouver, Canada and The Other Side (which drafted the contract) is located in Houston. The contract states that the amount Argon must pay is $1 million. QUESTION: Is this an issue? If so, is it worth burning up negotiation time by asking The Other Side to fix it? Discuss your reasoning.</li>

<li>MORE FACTS:  In the above situation, Argon really wants to get the contract to signature as soon as possible, like yesterday. You've tentatively concluded that it's not worth raising either of the above points (time of day and amount due) with The Other Side.  QUESTION: To be on the safe side and keep your malpractice-insurance carrier happy, what might you want to do about these points <i>before</i> sending your markup to The Other Side?</li>

<li>If all else fails in trying to interpret a contract provision, what Latin maxim will courts often follow, and what does it mean?</li>

<li>The term "12 midnight on January 21" refers to the next minute after 11:59 p.m. on: A)  January 20; B) January 21; C) can't tell from this text alone.</li>

<li>The Latin phrase for "against the offeror" is [BLANK].</li>

In some jurisdictions, certain types of clauses might not be enforceable unless they are "conspicuous." For clauses in this category, courts typically want extra assurance that the signers knowingly and voluntarily assented to the relevant terms and conditions. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Under the "express negligence" doctrine in Texas law (see <a href="#r-indem-def-excl-express-negl">16.3.4</a>), an indemnity provision that purports to protect a party from the consequences of its own negligence must not only be expressly stated, it must also be "conspicuous" in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code standard. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1749239368162039064">Dresser Indus., Inc. v. Page Petroleum, Inc.</a>, 853 S.W.2d 505, 508-09 (Tex. 1993) (adopting UCC's standard of conspicuousness for express-negligence indemnification doctrine). </cite>

<p>
Contract drafters sometimes put entire paragraphs into all-capital letters in the hope of making them "conspicuous." The reader has probably seen examples of this particular disorder in warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability.
</p>

<p>
But keeping the all-caps going for line, after line, after line, can be self-defeating. A Georgia supreme court justice noted that the drafter of a contract in suit had made the justice's job more difficult — which is not a good look, to put it mildly:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
No one should make the mistake of thinking, however, that capitalization always and necessarily renders the capitalized language conspicuous and prominent. 
</p>

<p>
In this case, <i>the entirety of the fine print appears in capital letters</i>, all in a relatively small font, rendering it difficult for the author of this opinion, among others, to read it. Moreover, <i>the capitalized disclaimers are mixed with a hodgepodge</i> of other seemingly unrelated, boilerplate contractual provisions — provisions about, for instance, a daily storage fee and a restocking charge for returned vehicles — <i>all of which are capitalized</i> and in the same small font. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14862188795670691881">Raysoni v. Payless Auto Deals, LLC</a>, 296 Ga. 156, 766 S.E.2d 24, 27 n.5 (2014) (reversing and remanding judgment on the pleadings) (emphasis and extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
In a similar vein, the Ninth Circuit noted acerbically:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Lawyers who think their caps lock keys are instant "'make conspicuous" buttons are deluded. &#x2026; A sentence in capitals, buried deep within a long paragraph in capitals will probably not be deemed conspicuous. Formatting does matter, but conspicuousness ultimately turns on the likelihood that a reasonable person would actually see a term in an agreement. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2969891887472318804">In re Bassett</a>, 285 F.3d 882, 886 (9th Cir. 2002) (cleaned up, emphasis and extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One more: In what might have been a subtle rebuke to the drafter(s) of a contract in suit, the Supreme Court of Texas reproduced an indemnification clause from the contract and added a footnote: "This text appeared in all capital letters in the original, but we have normalized the capitalization <i>for readability</i>." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12980552722768661702">Wagner v. Apache Corp.</a>, 627 S.W.3d 277, 280 n.1 (Tex. 2021) (affirming reversal of refusal to compel arbitration; emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Even worse, drafting a long block of text in all-caps <b>might actually hurt the drafter's own client</b>.  Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/luis_in_brief/status/1197245807730126848">a tweet</a> <i>[since deleted]</i> by Boston-area tech lawyer turned <a href="https://tidelift.com/">entrepreneur</a> Luis Villa:  "Love to see an ALL CAPS AND BOLD section of a contract that is so typographically painful to read that <i>the company’s lawyers didn’t actually proof it, and made a substantive error in my favor</i> as a result." (Emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
The drafting tips here, of course, are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Be judicious about what you put in all-caps.</li>

<li>Don't use too-small a font for language that you want to be conspicuous.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-consp-ucc">
<p>
The [U.S.] Uniform Commercial Code doesn't apply to all types of transaction, nor in jurisdictions where it has not been enacted. Still, the UCC's definition of "conspicuous," such as in <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/BC/htm/BC.1.htm#3411.2925">section UCC § 1-201</a>(10) (Texas version) nevertheless provides useful guidance:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
"Conspicuous," with reference to a term, means so written, displayed, or presented that <i>a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it</i>.  
</p>

<p>
Whether a term is "conspicuous" or not is a decision for the court.  
</p>

<p>
Conspicuous terms include the following:
</p>

<p>
(A)  a heading in capitals equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same or lesser size;  and
</p>

<p>
(B)  language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the surrounding text, 
</p>

<p>
or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/BC/htm/BC.1.htm#3411.2925">Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 1.201</a>(10) (emphasis and extra paragraphing added). </cite>e

<p>
Courts often adopt the UCC standard for conspicuousness, as explained in the next section.

<div id="outline-container-consp-fair" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="consp-fair"><span class="section-number-4">30.1.5.</span> Courts tend to focus on "fair notice"</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-consp-fair">
<p>
In a non-UCC context, the Supreme Court of Texas held that — apart from a possibly-significant exception for litigation-settlement releases — an indemnity provision protecting the indemnitee from its own negligence must be sufficiently conspicuous to provide "fair notice." The supreme court adopted the conspicuousness test stated in the UCC (quoted above), explaining:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
This standard for conspicuousness in <i>[Uniform Commercial]</i> Code cases is familiar to the courts of this state and conforms to our objectives of commercial certainty and uniformity.  We thus adopt the standard for conspicuousness contained in the Code for indemnity agreements and releases like those in this case that relieve a party in advance of responsibility for its own negligence.
</p>

<p>
<i>When a reasonable person against whom a clause is to operate ought to have noticed it, the clause is conspicuous.</i> For example, language in capital headings, language in contrasting type or color, <i>and language in an extremely short document</i>, such as a telegram, is conspicuous. <cite> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1749239368162039064">Dresser Indus., Inc. v. Page Petroleum, Inc.</a>, 853 S.W.2d 505, 508-09 (Tex. 1993) (citations omitted, emphasis and extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The court also pointed out that the fair-notice requirement did <i>not</i> apply to settlement releases: "Today's opinion applies the fair notice requirements to indemnity agreements and releases only when such exculpatory agreements are utilized to relieve a party of liability for its own negligence <i>in advance</i>." <cite> <i>Id.</i>, 853 S.W.2d at 508 n.1 (emphasis added). </cite>
</p>

<p>
What counts as "conspicuous" will sometimes depend on the circumstances.  In still another express-negligence case, the Texas supreme court said that the indemnity provision in question did indeed provide fair notice because:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
The entire contract between Enserch and Christie consists of one page; the indemnity language is on the front side of the contract and is not hidden under a separate heading.
</p>

<p>
The exculpatory language and the indemnity language, although contained in separate sentences, appear together in the same paragraph and the indemnity language is not surrounded by completely unrelated terms. Consequently, the indemnity language is sufficiently conspicuous to afford "fair notice" of its existence. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17184973092190281888">Enserch Corp. v. Parker</a>, 794 S.W.2d 2, 8-9 (Tex. 1990) (extra paragraphing added). </cite>e

<div id="outline-container-consp-actual" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="consp-actual"><span class="section-number-4">30.1.6.</span> Proven actual knowledge might be enough for conspicuousness</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-consp-actual">
<p>
In <i>Dresser</i>, the Texas supreme court noted an exception to the conspicuousness requirement: "The fair notice requirements are not applicable when <i>the indemnitee establishes</i> that the indemnitor possessed actual notice or knowledge of the indemnity agreement." <cite> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1749239368162039064">Dresser</a>, 853 S.W.2d at 508 n.2 (emphasis added, citation omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Note especially the italicized portion of the quotation, which implies that the burden of proof of actual notice or knowledge is on the party claiming indemnification from its own negligence.
</p>

<p>
In contrast: A federal district judge in Houston granted Enron's motion to dismiss Hewitt Associates' claim for indemnity, on grounds that the contract in question did not comply with the conspicuousness requirement of the "express negligence" rule, namely that an agreement to indemnify a party for the consequences of <i>the party's own negligence</i> must be both <i>express</i> and <i>conspicuous</i>).The judge surveyed prior cases in which actual knowledge (of an indemnity clause) had been sufficiently established, including by ways such as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>evidence of specific negotiation, such as prior drafts;</li>
<li>through prior dealings of the parties, for example, evidence of similar contracts over a number of years with a similar provision;</li>
<li>proof that the provisi</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3 id="safe-harbor"><span class="section-number-3">30.2.</span> Safe harbors: Useful for vague terms</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-safe-harbor">
<p>
The term "safe harbor" is sometimes used to denote <b>one, non-exclusive way of definitively complying</b> with a requirement; the term is used in, for example, tax law and securities law. <cite> See generally, e.g.: &bull; <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77z-2">15 U.S.C. § 77z-2</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78u-5">§ 78u-5</a> (safe harbors for forward-looking statements); Stephen Fishman, <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/landlords-must-be-in-business-to-claim-the-20-pass-through-tax-deduction.html">Landlords Must Be In Business to Claim the 20% Pass-Through Tax Deduction</a> (Nolo.com); <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safeharbor.asp">Safe harbor</a> (Investopedia.com). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Here's a hypothetical example: A lease states that Tenant must pay Landlord: (i) by a cashier's check drawn on a U.S. bank, or (ii) by other payment method reasonably acceptable to Landlord. Here, <b>the first option can be thought of as a safe harbor</b>: Other payment methods might be OK, but Tenant <i>knows</i> that a cashier's check can be used.
</p>

<p>
We can also define "reverse safe harbors," i.e., things that are clearly out-of-bounds, such as the prohibition on "unreasonable use" of computer systems at § <a href="#comp-sys-unrsnbl">3.2.6</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-serv-std-pers">

In a services agreement, a requirement for personnel qualifications can both reduce the likelihood of performance problems <b>and</b> make life simpler for customers to monitor performance — and to seek a remedy for problems that do arise.

<i>Scenario:</i> Suppose that you, the reader, are considering signing a contract with Scalpels 'R Us, LLC, a medical practice, to do lifesaving surgery on a loved one. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At a minimum, you'd want to know that the actual surgeon — the specific individual who'd be cutting into your loved one's body — was trained and qualified for the work, right? You wouldn't be satisified with a mere promise from Scalpels 'R Us that "we guarantee that the work will be done correctly, so please don't bother your little head with <i>who</i> will actually perform the surgery."</li>

<li>If things were to go wrong, you might well have the legal right to sue Scalpels 'R Us for monetary compensation (damages).</li>

<li>But that might be small comfort if the surgeon's screw-up had permanently injured your loved one (or worse).</li>
</ul>

<p>
So: An explicit personnel-qualifications requirement can serve as a reminder to Scalpels 'R Us about whom the provider should pick to do the surgery.
</p>

<p>
To be sure: A given services project might not be as important as surgery on a loved one. But the expense and inconvenience of work gone wrong can still be a pain in the [neck]. 
</p>

<p>
So, for similar reasons, services agreements often include requirements that the services be performed by individuals who are trained and qualified to do the work.
</p>

EXAMPLE: W.L. Gore, the manufacturer of Gore-Tex fabrics, sued both PeopleSoft and Deloitte Consulting for allegedly botching a major software roll-out — one of W.L.

In the absence of evidence comparing the '657 claim with the cefadroxil DC after ingestion Bristol has failed to establish any infringing use and therefore we must reverse the district court's conclusion that Zenith's sale of cefadroxil DC induces infringement of the '657 patent. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11478440640996054979">James Constr.

E.&nbsp; Another reason to include a qualifications clause: Returning to our Scalpels 'R Us hypothetical, suppose that things did indeed  go wrong during your loved one's surgery.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A lay jury, untrained in medical science, might have a tough time judging whether or not the surgical procedure had been performed correctly.</li>

<li>So, a "qualifications" clause provides an alternative "proof path" for the injured party: If it turned out that the surgeon didn't possess the necessary training, that would be its own breach of the contract, independent of whether the surgeon did or didn't do the work correctly.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-3-4">
<p>
High-school algebra students are taught to look for ways of simplifying formulae to make them easier to compute. We can usefully take a similar approach in formulating standards of contract performance.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> Consider the formula y =  (x<sup>2</sup>)−3) / (x^2−9​)

<div id="outline-container-sunset-n" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sunset-n"><span class="section-number-3">30.4.</span> Sunset provisions: Don't draft eternal rights or obligations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sunset-n">
<p>
It's almost always worth at least considering whether a particular right — or obligation — should have an explicit "sunset" date, i.e., a date certain (or a date-determinable) when the right or obligation comes to an end.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> Suppose that ABC Corp. is negotiating a confidentiality agreement under which ABC will be receiving confidential information of XYZ Inc. for a stated purpose.  In that situation, ABC might want its confidentiality obligations to come to an end automatically in X number of years, so that it won't have to think about and manage those obligations after that time.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-6-1">
<p>
Imagine that you're looking at <b>a simple list</b> of <i>titles</i> of a particular company's contracts — 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Perhaps you're doing due diligence for a financing- or merger transaction and reviewing a long list of the target company's existing contracts.</li>

<li>Perhaps you're doing a document review for a lawsuit or arbitration and looking at a similarly-long list of contracts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Consider the following styles of title:
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orga2e9c39" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga2e9c39"><span class="section-number-4">30.6.2.</span> Title style 1: The word "Agreement" by itself — don't</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-6-2">
<p>
<b>Title style 1</b> below is simplicity itself. But it's not especially informative when seen as part of a list of agreement titles:
</p>

<div class="centered" id="org645db91">
<div class="bordered" id="orgcf67bcb">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>   Agreement

</div>

</div>

<p>
EXAMPLE: See an "<a href="https://contracts.onecle.com/drugstore/amazon.sales.2000.01.24.shtml">Agreement</a>" between Amazon and Drugstores.com — you guessed it, the title is simply "Agreement," as in the title just above.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf2bc914" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf2bc914"><span class="section-number-4">30.6.3.</span> Title style 2: More information</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-6-3">
<p>
A more-expansive style is fairly typical for contracts:
</p>

<div class="centered" id="org86ffc6d">
<div class="bordered" id="org857c3a4">
<p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-6-4">
<p>
A third style is more informative still — but it might be overkill:
</p>

<div class="centered" id="org835ad04">
<div class="bordered" id="org60322cd">
<p>
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER <br>

and <br>
United States Steel Corporation<br>
</p>

<p>
Dated as of December 18, 2023 <br>
</p>

</div>

<p>
The example of title style 3, incidentally, is from the "<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1163302/000110465923126953/tm2333110d3_ex2-1.htm#">Agreement and Plan of Merger</a>" (that's the customary title for such contracts) under which Nippon Steel was to acquire U.S. Steel until the transaction was blocked by the U.S. Government.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> From title style 3, be careful about including "Dated as of &#x2026;" in the title because the contract date might change <i>but the old date might be inadvertently left in the document</i> — especially if there's a rush to get to signature; this would violate the Don't Repeat Yourself principle and could lead to trouble, as discussed at <a href="#dont-repeat">32.9</a>.

This is an example of following the <b>R.O.O.M.

The Verizon-Yahoo sentence calls to mind the early English translations of some of the Christian gospels, which literally translated the Greek conjunction καί (<i>kai</i>, "and") instead of using it as a separator, almost a punctuation mark, as the Greek-language authors had done — which led to some interesting run-on translations. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/6216.iv-2-multifunctionality-of-%CE%B4%CE%AD-%CF%84%CE%B5-and-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%AF">Multifunctionality of δέ, τε, and καί</a> (chs.harvard.edu; undated). </cite>|
</p>

<p>
See, for example, the Gospel of Mark, chapter 10, verses 33-34, in an almost-literal, word-for-word <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A33-34&version=YLT">translation</a> from the Greek "original":
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Lo, we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him  to the nations and they shall mock him and scourge him and spit on him and kill him and the third day he shall rise again.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Emphasis added.)  The King James Version's <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A33-34&version=KJV">translation of that passage</a>, published in 1611, didn't change much:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
</p>

<p>
And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Contrast the above translations with the modern <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A33-34&version=NIV">New International Version (NIV) translation</a> of the same passage:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2010%3A33-34&version=MSG">The Message</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
He took the Twelve and began again to go over what to expect next. "Listen to me carefully. We’re on our way up to Jerusalem. When we get there, the Son of Man will be betrayed to the religious leaders and scholars. They will sentence him to death. Then they will hand him over to the Romans, who will mock and spit on him, give him the third degree, and kill him. After three days he will rise alive."

The two shorter-sentence translations seem more readable, right?

A cautious drafting approach is to use the term <i>reduce</i> in lieu of <i>minimize</i>, against the chance that an adversary might later claim that "minimization" didn't actually occur, i.e., that the reduction that was actually achieved was not the greatest amount of reduction possible.

<h3 id="drafts-other-side"><span class="section-number-3">30.10.</span> Reviewing drafts from The Other Side</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-drafts-other-side">
<p>
Many contract drafters spend <i>at least</i> as much time reviewing others' draft contracts as they do in drafting their own. Here are a few pointers.
</p>

<p>
1.  <b>Do ask the other side for an editable Microsoft Word document</b>. And if you send <i>the other side</i> a draft or a redline, don't send a PDF or a locked Word- or PDF document — doing so implicitly signals a lack of trust; between lawyers especially, it's more than a little lacking in professional courtesy.
</p>

<p>
2.  <b>Do save your own new draft immediately:</b> Open the other party's draft in Microsoft Word <i>and immediately save it as a new document</i> whose file name reflects your revision. <i>Example of file name:</i> "Gigunda-MathWhiz-Services-Agreement-rev-2020-08-24.docx"
</p>

<p>
3.  <b>Do add a running header to show the revision date:</b> Add a running header to the top right of every page of your revision to show the version date and time (typed in, <b>not</b> an updatable field) (and matching the date in the file name). <i>Example of running header:</i> "REV. 2020-08-24 18:00 CDT" (note the use of military time for clarity).
</p>

<p>
4.  <b>Don't revise the other side's language just for style:</b> It's not worth spending scarce negotiation time — and it won't go over well with either the other side <i>or the client</i> — to ask the other side to change things that don't have a substantive effect.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> Suppose that the other side's draft contract leads off with "WITNESSETH" and a bunch of "WHEREAS:" clauses. As a well-trained drafter, you'd prefer to have a simple background section without all the legalese (see <a href="#bkgd-of-k">5.3</a> for more details). <b>Let it be:</b> If the other side's "WHEREAS:" clauses are <i>substantively</i> OK, don't  revise those clauses just because <i>you</i> (properly) prefer to use a plain-language style.
</p>

<p>
5.  <b>But do break up "spaghetti clause" provisions</b> in another party's draft to make the provisions easier for your client to review — and to help <i>you</i> to do a thorough review with lower risk of the MEGO factor ("Mine Eyes Glaze Over"). After you save a new Word document (see #2 above), do the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Double-space the entire text (except signature blocks and other things that should be left in single-space) if not that way already.</li>

<li>Break up long sentences, as explained in more detail at <a href="#thick-break">30.11.8</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
6.  <b>And do add an explanation for the added white space:</b> In the agreement title at the top of the draft, add a Word comment bubble along the lines of the following: 
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org4b92b08">
<p>
To make it easier for my client to review this draft, I'm taking the liberty of double-spacing it and breaking up some of the longer paragraphs.
</p>

</div>

<p>
(It's hard for another lawyer to object to your doing something to make things easier for your client, right?)  
</p>

<p>
The author has been doing this for years and has only once gotten pushback on that point from the original drafter — in fact, the parties pretty much always end up eventually signing a double-spaced version with broken-up paragraphs, as opposed to the original wall-of-words format.
</p>

<p>
7.  <b>Never gratuitously revise another party's draft to favor the <i>other</i> party</b> — even if your revision seems to make <i>business</i> sense — <i>and certainly not</i> if the revision might someday put your client at a disadvantage or give up an advantage.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> Suppose that this time your client MathWhiz is <i>a customer</i>, not a vendor. A vendor that wants to do business with MathWhiz has sent MathWhiz a draft contract. The draft calls for MathWhiz to pay the vendor's invoices "net 90 days" — that is, the vendor expects MathWhiz to pay in full in 90 days.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You know that vendors like to be paid as soon as they can, so you suspect that the vendor's <i>90-day</i> terms are a mistake, perhaps left over from a previous contract; i.e., the vendor's contract drafter might have taken a previous contract and changed the names, but without changing the 90-day terms to, say, 45-day terms.</li>

<li>You know that MathWhiz, like all customers, pretty-much always prefer to hold onto its cash for as long as they can — not least because delaying payment can give a customer a bit of extra leverage over its suppliers.</li>

<li>You also know that MathWhiz usually pays net-45 and is even willing to pay net-30 if the other terms are acceptable.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Let it be — don't take it on yourself</i> to unilaterally change the vendor's net-90 terms to net-45, because that would require MathWhiz to pay the vendor's invoices <i>earlier</i> than the vendor asked in its draft contract.
</p>

<p>
The vendor's drafter might later embarrassedly confess to having overlooked the net-90 terms and <i>ask</i> to change it to net-30. That gives MathWhiz an opportunity to be gracious, which will usefully signal to the vendor that MathWhiz might well be a Good Business Partner (which most companies like to see).
</p>

<p>
This is also a lesson about the possible danger of reusing an existing contract without carefully reviewing it to identify — and <i>possibly</i> strip out — any concessions that were made in the course of previous negotiations.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-k-rev-tips">
<p>
Many contract drafters spend <i>at least</i> as much time reviewing others' draft contracts as they do in drafting their own. Here are a few pointers.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important:</b> Many of these tips — but not all — apply equally to reviewing a "precedent" contract from your law firm, as in, if the partner giving you the drafting assignment tells you to "start with the contract from the XYZ deal that we did last year." (Also important: When this is the case, keep in mind that in the XYZ deal, your firm's client might have made concessions that your client in the new deal <b>doesn't</b> want to make, at least not to start.)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-11-1">
<p>
And if you send <i>the other side</i> a draft or a redline, don't send a PDF or a locked Word- or PDF document — doing so implicitly signals a lack of trust; between lawyers especially, it's more than a little lacking in professional courtesy.

To make discussion easier on a markup call with screen-sharing, use Microsoft Word's <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-remove-line-numbers-b67cd35e-422c-42eb-adc9-256ca9802e22">line-numbering feature</a> with <b>continuous</b> line numbering — that is, numbering continues sequentially on each new page. You'll save time because it's easier to refer to "line X" than to "section 14.3(a)(2)(F)." 
</p>

<p>
Here's a (sanitized) example from an actual draft NDA:

You might want to print the draft to PDF and circulate that along with the Word document, so that everyone has the same line numbering in the PDF. (Sometimes Microsoft Word seems to display things differently on different computers.)

<h4 id="redline-seq"><span class="section-number-4">30.11.5.</span> Redline your changes</h4>

<p>
Always use "Track Changes" in Microsoft Word (or whatever word processor you use).  See <a href="#r-sig-integ-top">2.9</a> for why it's vital to do this to avoid legitimately angering the other side. 
</p>

<p>
To show how redlining typically works, consider a hypothetical contract negotiation between two parties whose lawyers are "Fred" and "Ginger," respectively:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Fred emails Ginger Version 1 of a draft agreement, <i>very preferably</i> as an editable Microsoft Word document — <i>it's bad form</i> to email the other side a PDF or a locked Word document.</li>

<li>Using Microsoft Word, Ginger revises Version 1 <i>using Word's "Track Changes"</i> feature (alternatively, Word's "Compare Documents" feature) to show the proposed changes, then saves the revised document as Version 2.</li>

<li>Ginger emails her (revised) Version 2 to Fred.</li>

<li>Fred repeats what Ginger did to create a new Version 3 and emails Version 3 to Ginger.</li>

<li>Rinse and repeat until Fred's and Ginger's respective clients have reached agreement.</li>

<b>Pro tip:</b> It can also be helpful to explain, in comments — for example, in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/word/faq-about-comments-feature-in-word">Microsoft Word comment bubbles</a> — the reasoning behind specific changes, to save time in negotiation conference calls.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> In the final, signature version, drafters should consider including, in the "general provisions," a certification that neither party has made surreptitious changes to the signature version (see Protocol <a href="#r-sig-integ-top">2.9</a>).

Never gratuitously revise another party's draft to favor the <i>other</i> party:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>not even if your revision seems to make <i>business</i> sense; and</li>

<li>certainly not if the revision might someday put your client at a disadvantage or give up an advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p>
(This is different from the "hamburger for the guard dog" rule at <a href="#guard-dog-hamburger">30.21</a>.)
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Suppose that this time:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your client MathWhiz is <i>a customer</i>, not a vendor.</li>

<li>A vendor that wants to do business with MathWhiz has sent MathWhiz a draft contract.</li>

<li>The draft calls for MathWhiz to pay the vendor's invoices "<a href="#pmt-payer">net 90 days</a>" — that is, the vendor expects MathWhiz to pay in full in 90 days; see <a href="#pmt-payer">9.9.3</a>. (That'd  be really unusual for a <i>vendor</i> contract form.)</li>

<li>You know that vendors like to be paid as soon as they can. You suspect that the vendor's <i>90-day</i> terms are a mistake, perhaps left over from a previous contract: The vendor's contract drafter might have taken a previous contract and changed the names, but without changing the 90-day terms to, say, 45-day terms.</li>

<li>You know that MathWhiz, like all customers, pretty-much always prefer to hold onto its cash for as long as they can — not least because delaying payment can give a customer a bit of extra leverage over its suppliers.</li>

<li>You also know that MathWhiz usually pays net-45 and is even willing to pay net-30 if the other terms are acceptable.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Let it be — don't take it on yourself</b> to unilaterally change the vendor's net-90 terms to net-45. You don't want to <a href="#bar-clear">raise the bar</a> <a href="#bar-clear">30.13</a> for MathWhiz by requiring MathWhiz to pay the vendor's invoices <i>earlier</i> than the vendor had even asked for in its own draft contract.
</p>

<p>
To be sure: The vendor's drafter might later embarrassedly confess to having overlooked the net-90 terms and <i>ask</i> to change it to net-30. That's no bad thing:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It gives MathWhiz an opportunity to ask for a concession in return.</li>

<li>It also gives MathWhiz an opportunity to be gracious. Graciousness can send the message that MathWhiz might well be a Good Business Partner — and most companies like dealing with Good Business Partners.</li>

<p>
It's not worth spending scarce negotiation time — and it won't go over well with either the other side <i>or the client</i> — to ask the other side to change things that don't have a substantive effect.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Suppose that the other side's draft contract leads off with "WITNESSETH" and a bunch of "WHEREAS:" clauses. As a well-trained drafter, you'd prefer to have a simple background section. You'd have left out the legalese. (See <a href="#bkgd-of-k">5.3</a> for more details.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Let it be:</b> If the other side's "WHEREAS:" clauses are <i>substantively</i> OK, then don't revise those clauses just because <i>you</i> (properly) prefer to use a plain-language style.

<h4 id="thick-break"><span class="section-number-4">30.11.8.</span> But do break up "spaghetti paragraph" provisions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-thick-break">
<p>
Another party's draft is likely to have long <a href="#sssp">spaghetti paragraphs</a> (<a href="#sssp">32.3</a>). That might be accidental — or perhaps not.
</p>

<p>
So, break up spaghetti paragraphs into short, BLUF sound bites:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It'll make the clauses easier for your client to review.</li>
<li>It'll also help <i>you</i> to do a thorough review with lower risk of the MEGO factor ("Mine Eyes Glaze Over").</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Expand single-spaced paragraphs</b>: After you save a new Word document (see <a href="#rev-new-dr">30.11.2</a> above), use 1.5-line spacing, or even double-spacing, for the entire text if not that way already. 
</p>

<p>
(Exception: Stick with single-spacing for signature blocks and other text blocks that would look strange with more line spacing.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Break up long sentences,</b> as explained in more detail at <a href="#sssp">32.3</a>.
</p>

<p>
(For an example of how that might look, see the screen shot at <a href="#rev-line-no">30.11.4</a>.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Add an explanation for the added white space:</b> In the agreement title at the top of the draft, add a Word comment bubble along the lines of the following:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="orge041cfe">
<p>
To make it easier for my client to review this draft, I'm taking the liberty of double-spacing it and breaking up some of the longer paragraphs, without redlining those particular changes.
</p>

</div>

<p>
It's hard for another lawyer to object to your doing something to make things easier for your client, right?
</p>

<p>
(Again, for an example of how that might look, see the screen shot at <a href="#rev-line-no">30.11.4</a>.)
</p>

<p>
<i>DCT note:</i> I've been doing this for many years and have only twice gotten pushback on that point from The Other Side. For that matter, the parties pretty much always end up eventually signing a double-spaced version with broken-up paragraphs, as opposed to the original spaghetti-clause format.

<h4 id="drafts-del"><span class="section-number-4">30.11.9.</span> Don't delete emailed drafts</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-drafts-del">
<p>
First drafts and redlined revised drafts are almost universally exchanged by email. Here's why you should always keep every draft sent to, or by, (i) the other side of a deal or (ii) your client:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Email storage space is cheap.</li>

<li>Deleting emails relating to a transaction or relationship means that you don't have a complete documentary history — and the other side might have emails that you don't, possibly giving them an advantage.</li>

<li>If you think you've deleted "problematic" emails, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy's Law</a> — "anything that can go wrong, will go wrong" — says you could be deluding yourself: Someone else could have a copy (possibly forwarded), and/or there could be backup copies somewhere that would turn up in litigation; it's far better to have your own complete set.</li>

<li>In litigation, it's low-hanging fruit for the other side to accuse your client of destruction of evidence ("spoliation"):

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trial counsel love to be able to make such accusations, because jurors might not understand the complexities of the case, but they <i>will</i> understand "Cover-up!!"</li>

<li>If a judge gives jurors an adverse-inference instruction about your client's spoliation of evidence, that can be big trouble.</li>

<li>And in an extreme spoliation case, the judge might take even-more drastic action such as precluding certain claims and/or defenses or even striking your client's pleadings.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-bar-tilly's">
<p>
EXAMPLE: <i>Multiple-signature requirements:</i> Tilly's, Inc. and World of Jeans & Tops, Inc. ("Tilly's") had an employee sign an employment agreement (the "2001 employment agreement").
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The 2001 employment agreement included a provision requiring arbitration of disputes (concerning arbitration, see <a href="#r-arb-sop">23.1</a>), but the arbitration provision had a carve-out for statutory claims, meaning that the employee was allowed to file a lawsuit for such claims in court and didn't need to arbitrate them.</li>

<li>Importantly for our purposes here: The 2001 employment agreement also stated that <i>any modifications to the agreement's terms would need the signatures of three company executives:</i> The president, senior vice president, and director of human resources.</li>

<li>Fast forward to 2005: The company had its employees sign an acknowledgement of receipt of an employee handbook containing a <i>revised</i> arbitration provision — which <i>didn't</i> contain the carve-out for statutory claims and thus was more favorable to the company.</li>

<li>But the employees' signed acknowledgements <i>didn't contain the three executive signatures</i> needed to modify the 2001 employment agreement. (I'd guess that the company's HR people simply didn't remember that three signatures were required.)</li>

<li>So: Because the company had previously set the bar so high for modifying the 2001 employment agreement, the company found itself facing high-stakes, class-action <i>litigation</i>, whereas it had thought that it would be <i>arbitrating</i> individual, low-stakes claims, one by one. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10882894982323205158">Rebolledo v. Tilly's, Inc.</a>, 228 Cal. App. 4th 900, 924, 175 Cal. Rptr. 3d 612 (Cal. App. 4th Div. 2014) (affirming denial of motion to compel arbitration). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
To like effect, in a 2025 California case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A worker signed an employment agreement that included a mandatory arbitration provision that included a prohibition of class-action arbitration.</li>

<li>At the end of the document, the agreement form said, "<b>The parties</b> acknowledge and agree <i>[sic]</i> that each has read this agreement carefully and understand that <b>by signing it, each is waiving</b> all rights to a trial or hearing before a judge or jury of any and all disputes and claims subject to arbitration under this agreement."</li>

<li><b>The company never signed</b> the worker's agreement.</li>

<li>After leaving the company, the worker filed a class-action lawsuit alleging wage-and-hour violations .</li>

<li>The company move to compel arbitration and to strike the class-action claims.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The district court ruled that the arbitraiton agreement was not binding on the worker because <b>the company hadn't signed</b> the agreement; the appeals court affirmed. <cite> See <a href="https://www4.courts.ca.gov/opinions/nonpub/B331219.PDF">Pich v.

<p>
If a confidentiality agreement is drafted to favor the recipient of information, the agreement might state that discloser information isn't considered confidential if the information isn't marked as such when provided to the recipient. That's dangerous because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the NDA didn't <i>need</i> to be so strict about marking; and</li>

<li>in more than one case, such NDA strictness about marking resulted in the discloser forfeiting any chance of asserting trade-secret rights in the information it provided to the recipient (see the notes at § <a href="#conf-info-mkg">11.3.15</a>).</li>

<i>Example: Information-purge requirements:</i> Confidentiality agreements often require the party receiving confidential information to purge — return or destroy — <i>all</i> copies of the information in its possession upon termination of the agreement.

</p>

<p>
<i>Example: Spaces to be initialed, that aren't:</i> Here's a variation on the blank-spaces problem: A contract drafter might add blank lines by particular provisions, to be initialed by one or more signers to acknowledge understanding tose provisions — but what if a signer doesn't initial in the spaces provided?

<h4 id="coco"><span class="section-number-4">30.14.1.</span> The Conan O'Brien example</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-coco">
<p>
Some of you might remember that TV talk-show host <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien#The_Tonight_Show_(2009%E2%80%932010)">Conan O'Brien's stewardship of The Tonight Show</a> (now hosted by Jimmy Fallon) proved disappointing to NBC. - The network decided to move former host Jay Leno back into the 11:35 p.m. (Eastern) time slot and bump Conan back to 12:05 a.m. This led Conan to want to leave the show and start over on another network — but if he had, he would arguably have been in breach of his contract with NBC.
</p>

<p>
Conan's contract apparently did <span class="underline">not</span> state that <i>The Tonight Show</i> would always start at 11:35 p.m. Conan's lawyers were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-conans-lawyers-screwed-up-forgot-to-specify-tonight-show-time-slot-2010-1">roundly criticized</a> for that alleged mistake. But then wiser heads pointed out that <b>Conan's lawyers might have <i>intentionally</i> not asked</b> for a locked-in start time:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The Tonight Show had started at 11:35 p.m. for decades; Conan's lawyers could have plausibly argued that this start time was part of the essence of <i>The Tonight Show</i>, and thus was an implied part of the contract.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Suppose that Conan's lawyers <span class="underline">had</span> asked for the contract to lock in the 11:35 p.m. start time of <i>The Tonight Show</i> — but that NBC had refused. A court might then have interpreted the contract as providing that NBC had at least some freedom to move the show's start time.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  And for that matter, NBC might have responded by demanding a clause affirmatively stating that NBC was free to choose the start time for <i>The Tonight Show</i>. Given that NBC had more bargaining power than Conan at that point, Conan might then have had no choice but to agree, given that he wanted NBC to appoint him as the host of the show. And in that case, there'd be no question that NBC had the right to push the start time of the show back to 12:05 p.m.

<p>
Ultimately, Conan and NBC settled their dispute; the network bought out Conan's contract for a reported $32.5 million. This seems to suggest that NBC was concerned it might indeed be breaching the contract if it were to push back The Tonight Show to 12:05 a.m. as it wanted to do. 
</p>

<p>
As an article in <i>The American Lawyer</i> commented:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
"Sometimes in contract negotiations it's better not to ask," says Jonathan Handel &#x2026;. 
</p>

<p>
* * *
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; If O'Brien had asked that the 11:35 p.m. time slot be spelled out in any agreement—and had NBC refused—the red pompadoured captain of "Team Coco" would be in a weaker position in the current negotiations.
</p>

<p>
"If you ask and are refused, or even worse, if you ask and the other side pushes for a 180, such as a time slot not being guaranteed, you can end up with something worse," [attorney Jonathan] Handel adds. 
</p>

<p>
Without having their hands bound by language in the contract on when "The Tonight Show" would air, O'Brien's lawyers are in a better position to negotiate their client's departure from NBC. <cite> Brian Baxter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120718012604/https://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2010/01/conan2.html">Legal Angles Abound as Conan-NBC Standoff Nears Endgame</a> (AmLaw Daily Jan. 19, 2010) (extra paragraphing added) ] It could well be that Conan's lawyers did an A-plus job of playing a comparatively-weak hand during the original contract negotiations with NBC.
</p>

<p>
The lesson: <b>Be careful what you ask for in a contract negotiation</b> — if the other side rejects your request but you do the deal anyway, that sequence of events might come back to haunt you later.

<p>
The scene: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You're in a contract negotiation, representing The Good Guys Company.</li>

<li>The other side, Nasty Business Partner Inc., insists on requiring The Good Guys to get NBP's consent before assigning the agreement.</li>

<li>Nasty Business Partner has all the bargaining power; the Good Guys decide they have no choice but to go along.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Trying to salvage the situation, you ask Nasty Business Partner  for some additional language: "Consent to assignment may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned." But Nasty Business Partner refuses. <b>Have you just hurt your client?</b>
</p>

<p>
In <i>some</i> jurisdictions — by no means all — <i>The Good Guys might otherwise have benefited from a default rule</i> that Nasty Business Partner Inc. had an <i>implied</i> obligation not to unreasonably withhold consent to an assignment of the contract; see <a href="#assmt-cons-no-unrsnbl">Note</a> for discussion.
</p>

<p>
But you <i>asked</i> for an express obligation — only to have Nasty Business Partner reject the request — and The Good Guys signed the contract anyway.
</p>

<p>
A court might therefore conclude that the parties had agreed that Nasty Business Partner would not be under an obligation not to unreasonably withhold its consent to assignment — that NBP could grant or withhold its consent in its sole discretion. That's pretty much what happened in two different state supreme-court cases, one in Alabama and the other in Oregon. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14754343401549936655">Shoney's LLC v.

<p>
Your client might not have the bargaining power to get its way in contract negotiations. When that's the case, you have to try to come up with other ways to help protect the client's legal- and business interests.
</p>

<p>
Imagine, for example, that your client is a customer that is negotiating a master purchasing contract with a vendor.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your customer client would love to flatly prohibit the vendor from raising prices without the customer's consent. But the vendor's negotiators won't go along with such a prohibition.</li>

<li>The vendor would love to have the unfettered discretion to raise your customer client's prices whenever the vendor wants. But your client's business people are insisting on having at least some protection on that score.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What to do? In no particular order, here are some approaches that you could try.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf22f658" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf22f658"><span class="section-number-4">30.15.1.</span> Non-discrimination language?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-15-1">
<p>
A non-discrimination requirement at least brings a bit of overall-market discipline into the picture.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> "Provider will not increase the prices it charges to Customer except as part of a non-targeted, across-the-board pricing increase by Provider, applicable to its customers generally, for the relevant goods or services."
</p>

<p>
Comment: The Provider might want to qualify this language, so as to limit how general a price increase must be before it can be applied to the Customer.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-15-2">
<p>
An advance-warning or advance-consultation requirement can buy time for its beneficiary to look around for alternatives (assuming of course that the contract doesn't lock in the beneficiary somehow, for example with a minimum-purchase requirement or a "requirements" provision).
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> Provider will give Customer at least X [days | months] advance notice of any increase in the pricing it charges to Customer under this Agreement.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org487d17f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org487d17f"><span class="section-number-4">30.15.3.</span> Transparency requirement?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-15-3">
<p>
Requiring a party to provide information justifying its action, upon request, can force that party to think twice about doing something, even though it technically is free to do it.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example: 
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="orgff6c3c9">
<p>
If requested by Customer within X days after notice of a pricing increase, Provider will seasonably provide Customer with documentation showing, with reasonable completeness and accuracy, a written explanation of the reason for the increase, including reasonable details about Provider's relevant cost structures relevant to the pricing increase. 
</p>

<p>
Customer will maintain all such documentation in confidence any non-public information in such explanation, will not disclose the non-public information to third parties, and will use it only for purposes of making decisions about potential purchases under this Agreement.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Comment Note the <i>if-requested</i> language, which relieves the vendor from the burden of continually managing this requirement — although a smart vendor would plan ahead and have the required documentation ready to go.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-15-4">
<p>
When a party makes tough contract demands, it could be because the party has been burned before. Institutionally, it may still "feel the pain" of a bad experience; its response is to roar at other counterparties.
</p>

<p>
The counterparty being roared at can try to find out why the lion is roaring. If it can identify the source of the pain, it might be able to figure out another way to make it better, without undertaking burdensome obligations. (The allusion here, of course, is to the ancient folk tale about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androcles">Androcles and the lion</a>.)

<h4 id="org113e325"><span class="section-number-4">30.15.5.</span> Cap the financial exposure for the onerous provision?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-15-5">
<p>
A party with bargaining power will often demand that its counterparty agree to an onerous provision. In response, the counterparty could ask the first party to agree to a dollar cap on the amount of the counterparty's resulting financial exposure, e.g., capping the amount of money that the counterparty would be required to spend or the liability that it might someday face. 
</p>

<p>
If the first party agrees, the onerous provision might look less dangerous to the counterparty than it would with the prospect of unlimited expense and/or liability. 
</p>

<p>
(This is a variation on the old saying: <i>When in doubt, make it about money</i>.)

<h4 id="org53e468e"><span class="section-number-4">30.15.6.</span> Impose time limits?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-15-6">
<p>
When a party asks its counterparty to agree to an onerous contract provision, the counterparty might try to make its business risk more manageable by imposing time limits on the onerous provision, such as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>specified start- or end dates; and/or</li>
<li>specified duration(s).</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, if a party demands an oppressive indemnity obligation, the counterparty might counter by asking for a time limit on claims covered by the indemnity.
</p>

<p>
Or if a party demands a cap on pricing increases, or a most-favored-customer clause, the counterparty could counter with time limits on those as well.

<h4 id="org1e1d864"><span class="section-number-4">30.15.8.</span> Package as part of a premium offering?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-15-8">
<p>
Suppose that a smallish supplier is regularly asked by its customers to agree to an onerous contract provision (e.g., an extended warranty). If the supplier plans ahead, it can package the onerous provision as part of a <i>higher-priced</i> premium offering — with the relevant contract language being written in a way the supplier knows it can support.
</p>

<p>
This approach has a distinct advantage: The bargaining over whether to give a customer the premium offering is no longer about legal T&Cs: it becomes a negotiation about <b>price</b>. This means the supplier's legal people might not even have to get involved — which often can be crucial when sales people are working hard to close deals before the shot clock runs down on the fiscal quarter.
</p>

<p>
Another advantage: The supplier might well score points with customers for anticipating their needs and offering a solution for them.
</p>

<p>
A third advantage: Some customers are far less <i>price</i>-sensitive than they are <i>service</i>-sensitive, in that they're willing to pay more if they feel they're getting premium treatment. (Airlines sell a lot of first&#x2011; and business-class seats, whose high prices supposedly subsidize lower-cost fares for us peasants back in steerage.)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-30-15-9">
<p>
The supplier and its lawyer should assess the actual business risk of agreeing to the customer's request — in the real world it might not be as big a problem as the supplier imagines.
</p>

<p>
That's always the <i>client's</i> call, of course — but for <i>legal</i> matters, the client might want the lawyer's view about what's being asked; I often use the phrase, "<i>[The provision in question]</i> probably represents an acceptable business risk."
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> In such a situation, the lawyer should pay attention to whether s/he is being asked to give <i>legal</i> advice or <i>business</i> advice; the latter could jeopardize the attorney-client privilege (<a href="#nl-atty-priv-c">30.30</a>).¯

<h4 id="tillys"><span class="section-number-4">30.16.1.</span> Example: Tilly's raises the bar — and then fails to clear it</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-tillys">
<p>
<a href="https://www.tillys.com/">Tilly's, Inc.</a> and World of Jeans & Tops, Inc. ("Tilly's") had an employee sign an employment agreement (the "2001 employment agreement") containing an arbitration provision. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The 2001 employment agreement included a carve-out for statutory claims (which thus could be brought in court, not in arbitration). <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10882894982323205158">Rebolledo v. Tilly's, Inc.</a>, 228 Cal. App. 4th 900, 924, 175 Cal. Rptr. 3d 612 (Cal. App. 4th Div. 2014) (affirming denial of motion to compel arbitration). </cite></li>

<li>Importantly: The 2001 employment agreement also stated that any modifications to the agreement would need the signatures of three executives: The company's president; senior vice president; and director of human resources.</li>

<li>Then in 2005, the company had its employees sign an acknowledgement of receipt of an employee handbook containing a different arbitration provision — which didn't contain the carve-out for statutory claims.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If that different arbitration provision had gone into effect, then Tilly's would have had more protection from employee class-action lawsuits.
</p>

<p>
BUT: The signed 2005 acknowledgement <i>didn't contain the three executive signatures</i> needed to modify the 2001 employment agreement. 
</p>

<p>
Summing up: Tilly's had set the bar very high for modifying the 2001 employment agreement — but then it hadn't cleared the bar itself to give itself more protection against employee class-action litigation.  So, the company found itself facing high-stakes litigation by <i>a class</i> of employee plaintiffs — whereas it had <i>thought</i> it would be arbitrating low-stakes claims on a one-by-one basis. 
</p>

Judges seem to appreciate a bit of verbal <i>(as in, relating to words)</i> humility in contracts; they’ve been known to look askance at high-handed statements in contracts that purport to bind courts such as, e.g., "the parties hereby elect not to be bound by any state laws" (when maritime law would apply). <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13847740586706779114">Barranco v. 3D Sys.

<p>
In its <i>Barranco</i> opinion, the Ninth Circuit rejected the notion that a court was <i>required</i> to issue an injunction if the parties had agreed to it. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We hold that the terms of a contract alone cannot require a court to grant equitable relief.

<p>
Likewise, the Delaware chancery court disregarded a contractual stipulation of irreparable harm:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Parties sometimes &#x2026; agree that contractual failures are to be deemed to impose the risk of irreparable harm. Such an understanding can be helpful when the question of irreparable harm is a close one.  
</p>

<p>
Parties, however, cannot in advance agree to assure themselves (<i>and thereby impair the Court’s exercise of its well-established discretionary role</i> in the context of assessing the reasonableness of interim injunctive relief) the benefit of expedited judicial review through the use of a simple contractual stipulation that a breach of that contract would constitute irreparable harm. <i>[In footnote 20 the court added:]</i> In part, this is simply a matter that allocation of scarce judicial resources is a judicial function, not a demand option for litigants. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5256805908002861233">AM General Holdings LLC v.

R elatedly: In a different context, another court noted: "Since federal courts are not rubber stamps, parties may not, by private agreement, relieve them of their obligation to review arbitration awards for compliance with § 10(a) [of the Federal Arbitration Act]." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11023880277516989724">Hoeft v.

Similarly, Delaware's supreme court affirmed a court of chancery holding that a "conclusive and binding" provision in a corporation's charter was invalid under Delaware corporate law because, said the supreme court, the provision "strips the Court of Chancery of its authority to apply established standards of review to breach of fiduciary duty claims." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=551047043438978824">CCSB Fin.

Similarly, parties should not count on getting a court to rubber-stamp their request to order filed documents to be "sealed," that is, kept from public access. For example, the Fifth Circuit implicitly criticized a district court (while nonetheless affirming summary judgment) because the lower court had granted a broad agreed protective order, which had the effect of sealing documents: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Judicial records belong to the American people; they are public, not private, documents. 
</p>

<p>
Certainly, some cases involve sensitive information that, if disclosed, could endanger lives or threaten national security. But increasingly, courts are sealing documents in run-of-the-mill cases where the parties simply prefer to keep things under wraps.
</p>

<p>
This is such a case. The secrecy is consensual, and neither party frets that 73 percent of the record is sealed. But we do, for three reasons. 
</p>

<p>
First, courts are duty-bound to protect public access to judicial proceedings and records.
</p>

<p>
Second, that duty is easy to overlook in stipulated sealings like this one, where the parties agree, the busy district court accommodates, and nobody is left in the courtroom to question whether the decision satisfied the substantive requirements. 
</p>

<p>
Third, this case is not unique, but consistent with the growing practice of parties agreeing to private discovery and presuming that whatever satisfies the lenient protective-order standard will necessarily satisfy the stringent sealing-order standard. Below, we review the interests at stake and the exacting standard for sealing that protects those interests. Then, we explain the concerns raised by the sealings in this case. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6073153356769412567">Le v.

Basically the same explanation was offered by the federal district court for the Southern District of New York, in a decision in which the court:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<p>
Here, the Exhibits — the Final Arbitration Award, the Partial Final Arbitration Award, and the [Master Services Agreement] between the parties — directly affect the adjudication of the Petition, and are therefore judicial documents.

<p>
That the Court need not decide the merits of the Petition does not change the fact that the Exhibits are judicial documents. Moreover, because the information contained in the Exhibits directly affects the adjudication of the Petition, <i>a strong presumption of public access applies</i>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4124998403063394501">Susquehanna Int'l Grp.

In a Ninth Circuit decision, the ride-share company Uber sought mandamus to defeat a preliminary "centralization" decision in a class-action lawsuit; the court rejected Uber's assertion that Uber's arbitration agreement precluded the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ("JPML") from ordering "centralization" of the claims against Uber:

<p>
Where a federal statute vests a court with the power (or duty) to act of its own accord, a private agreement cannot bind the court and the agreement is entitled to only so much consideration as provided for by Congress. Forum selection clauses neatly illustrate this rule. A forum selection clause cannot eliminate a district court’s jurisdiction to hear a suit. &#x2026; Rather, courts enforce forum selection clauses because the general change-of-venue statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) requires that such agreements be considered in the venue analysis.

A court might well disregard a contractual statement that a noncompetition covenant was acknowledged to be valid and enforceable.  EXAMPLE: As Delaware's chancery court noted  in its <i>Kodiak</i> opinion:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
The RCA's language stating its restrictive covenants are reasonable, and waiving a defense that they are not, does not preclude this Court from performing the reasonableness analysis our law mandates. Kodiak cannot rely on those provisions to evade review and establish a reasonable probability of success on the merits. 
</p>

<p>
After analyzing the contract's reasonableness under the common law test, I find the RCA's restrictive covenants in Sections 1 and 2 are unreasonable, and consequently unenforceable.

Some drafters don't seem to appreciate the need for verbal humility. Consider the following imperious language in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066134/000119312510000891/dex103.htm">Bank of America guaranty</a>:

<p>
This is more than a little presumptuous, no?

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-use-industry-standard-terminology">
<p>
When you're drafting a contract, you'll want to try to avoid coining your own non-standard words or phrases to express technical or financial concepts. If there's an industry-standard term that fits what you're trying to say, use that term if you can. Why? For two reasons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, someday you might have to litigate the contract, and so:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You'll want to make it as easy as possible for the judge (and his- or her law clerk) and the jurors to see the world the way you do. In part, that means making it as easy as possible for them to understand the contract language.</li>

<li>The odds are that the witnesses who testify in deposition or at trial likely will use industry-standard terminology. So the chances are that the judge and jurors will have an easier time if the contract language is consistent with the terminology that the witnesses use—that is, if the contract "speaks" the same language as the witnesses.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Second, and perhaps equally important: The business people on both sides are likely to be more comfortable with the contract if it uses familiar language, which could help make the negotiation go a bit more smoothly.</li>

<div id="outline-container-fns" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="fns"><span class="section-number-3">30.20.</span> Footnotes in contracts?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-fns">
<p>
Suppose that, after intense negotiations, a particular contract clause ends up being written in a very specific way. <i>Consider including a footnote at that point in the contract</i>, explaining how the language came to be what it is.  Future readers — your client's successor, your client's trial counsel, a judge — might thank you for it. 
</p>

<p>
DCT note: When I was in-house at <a href="#bio">BindView</a>, our standard enterprise license agreement form was extremely customer-friendly (this was intentional, <a href="#nl-bal-terms">to help us get to signature sooner</a>). But at first I still had to spend a lot of time explaining to customers' lawyers <i>why</i> the agreement form included certain terms.
</p>

<p>
To save negotiation time, I added a fair number of explanatory footnotes to our license-agreement form. The footnotes <i>seemed</i> to reduce, by quite a lot, the amount of time needed for "legal" negotiations.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, our business people were please to get deals to signature sooner. 
</p>

<p>
And interestingly, <i>customers' lawyers hardly ever asked us to delete the footnotes</i> before contract signatur.
</p>

<p>
With footnotes left in, if the contract were ever litigated (which never once happened), the footnotes would be available to be read:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>by opposing counsel;</li>
<li>by the judge's law clerk;</li>
<li>by the judge him- or herself; and</li>
<li>by one or more of the jurors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That'd be no bad thing.
</p>

<p>
To be sure: In litigation, hindsight you might wish you hadn't said what you did in the footnotes. <i>But that could happen with <span class="underline">any</span> provision or phrasing in the contract</i>. 
</p>

<p>
What's important here is that the overwhelming majority of contracts never see the inside of a courtroom. So, <i>on balance</i> it's likely that the client will get more <i>overall</i> business benefit from including footnotes — <b>if</b> doing so will help get the client's contracts to signature sooner.

<p>
This rule is related to the <i><a href="#FFri">Freaky Friday</a></i> rule: Sometimes you'll find yourself drafting the contract, or perhaps you'll be proposing to add a significant new section to another party's draft. In either situation, it can pay to include a clause of a kind that you know the other side will insist on getting, because you can draft it to your client's advantage.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Suppose that you're drafting a contract under which your client must pay The Other Side a percentage of its (your client's) sales. 
</p>

<p>
The contract might be a commercial real-estate lease for a store in a shopping mall, where each quarter your client (the tenant) must report to the landlord (the mall owner) the amount of the tenant's gross sales at the store. Your client would then have to pay the landlord, not just a fixed base rent for the store, but also a specified percentage of the store's gross sales. This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_rent">percentage rent</a>.
</p>

<p>
Often the shopping-mall landlord will have superior bargaining power and will insist on using its own lease form. And that lease form will almost certainly include an audit provision such as that of  Protocol <a href="#r-audit-proto">9.1</a>: The audit provision would give the landlord the right to have the tenant's sales records audited, to confirm whether or not the tenant has paid the correct amount of percentage rent.
</p>

<p>
But if <i>you're</i> drafting the lease form — for example, if the landlord is inexperienced compared to your client the tenant — then <b>you might be tempted to omit an audit clause from your draft lease</b>. Your reasoning could be that landlord's contract reviewers might not think to ask for an audit provision, and it's not your job to remind them — which is certainly true.
</p>

<p>
<b>But</b> consider these points:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <b>It might be wishful thinking</b> (or delusional) to imagine that the landlord's contract reviewer won't notice the absence of an audit clause — the reviewer could well be an expert who knows exactly what to look for and what to demand.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;   Suppose that the landlord's contract reviewer were to see a reasonable audit clause in your draft. <b>He or she might well mentally check the box</b> — <i>yup, they've got an audit clause, it's not perfect for us but it'll do, let's move on</i> — and not make significant changes to your wording. That'd be a win for you, not least because it'd one less thing to have to spend precious time negotiating.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <b>You might be better off setting a friendly tone</b> with an audit clause <i>that you know your client the tenant can live with</i> — and then, if the landlord makes unreasonable change requests, you can try standing on principle to reject the requests. (See also <a href="#cant-say-no">30.15</a> for when you just can't say no to an unreasonable request.)
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Suppose that the landlord's drafters really <i>don't</i> know what they're doing: Chances are you'll get them to signature faster — and you'll be laying a foundation for a trusted relationship — if your draft seems to address the landlord's "<b>legitimate needs and greeds</b>" in a reasonable way along with your own client's needs. (BUT: Don't go overboard with this.) <cite> "Legitimate needs and greeds" is a phrase used by the renowned intellectual-property attorney Tom Arnold (1923-2009). See Tom Arnold, <i>Basic Considerations in Licensing</i>, in <i>Recent Developments in Licensing</i> at 6-22 (American Bar Association Section of Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Law 1981), <i>quoted in</i> Homer O. Blair, <a href="https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&context=ncilj">Overview of Licensing and Technology Transfer</a>, 8 N.C. J. Int'l L. 167, 190 (1982). Tom, the founding partner of my former law firm, was a mentor and friend; I've included a brief remembrance at <a href="#org337d52e">6.1</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Finally: This rule applies only when you're the drafter, not the reviewer. As discussed at <a href="#hamb-no">30.11.6</a>, when you're reviewing the other side's draft contract, <b>it's not your job</b> to propose provisions that could disadvantage your client and that <b>The Other Side didn't think to ask for</b>.

<p>
A few years ago, a new client of mine was negotiating a fairly-large transaction with a prospective customer.  The client's sales team had sent the customer the company's then-standard contract form, which I hadn't drafted.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The client's contract form included a forum-selection provision requiring all litigation to take place exclusively in Houston, which was the client's headquarters city. (Concerning forum selection, see Protocol <a href="#r-forum-sel">23.11</a>.)</li>

<li>The customer's lawyer saw the forum-selection clause and said it needed to be reversed, so that the <i>exclusive</i> forum would be the <i>customer's</i> home city — let's say that was Cleveland.</li>

<li>That contract change wouldn't have been great for my client. Sure, it was unlikely that the client would get into litigation with any customer. But still, being forced to litigate <i>in Cleveland</i> would have been costly and inconvenient.</li>

<li>The client's sales people said this was an important sale and that the company was willing to concede the forum-selection point.</li>

<li>Somewhat surprisingly, the customer's lawyer went along with my suggestion that we just drop the forum-selection clause entirely, instead of agreeing to Cleveland as the exclusive forum — the lawyer might not have realized that this could have turned out to be a significant concession.<sup><a id="fnr.ForumCleveland" class="footref" href="#fn.ForumCleveland" role="doc-backlink">43</a></sup></li>

<b>Lesson</b> <i>(mixing the metaphors here)</i>: Don't "poke the bear" (see <a href="#poke-bear">30.14</a>) by lobbing a hand-grenade clause that the bear could throw back at you — and leave your client worse off than having no clause at all.

<h3 id="false-imper"><span class="section-number-3">30.23.</span> False imperatives: Whose throat to choke?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-false-imper">
<p>
A "false imperative" is a provision in a contract — commonly written in passive voice, see <a href="#active">34.1</a> — where the provision proclaims that something is to be done, but leaves it unclear just who is responsible for making it happen.
</p>

<p>
Here's a hypothetical example — consider an apartment lease that says:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org06fb57e">
<p>
The apartment shall be regularly serviced by a professional pest-control service.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Who's responsible for making sure this happens? Is it the landlord, or the tenant? Either one seems plausible. 
</p>

<p>
Context can matters (see <a href="#ambig-wha">29.1</a>); if the pest-control requirement is in a section titled, e.g., "Tenant's responsibilities," then that would likely resolve the question.
</p>

<p>
But it's better to assume that in a lawsuit or arbitration, "someone" might try to quote the requirement <i>out</i> of context. (Nah: Lawyers would never do that — would they?)
</p>

<p>
You could think of a false imperative as being like baseball players who let an easily-catchable fly ball drop to the ground between them — because each player assumes that "someone else" will get it, and so no one "calls it."
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: This comes up in real life: In a Houston case, a limited-partnership agreement provided that a partner was to be paid money, but the agreement used the passive-voice "shall be paid." This led to presumably-costly litigation over just <span class="underline">who</span> was supposed to make the payment — was it the limited partnership, or the general partner?
</p>

<p>
Here's another example of a false imperative, this one hypothetical — suppose that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A real-estate developer enters into a construction agreement with a general contractor;</li>
<li>Under the construction agreement, the contractor is to build a building;</li>
<li>Because of the nature of the building site, special safety procedures will be needed for all personnel coming on the site;</li>
<li>The construction agreement says simply: "<i>All Developer personnel are to be trained in special safety procedures for the Building Site</i>."</li>
</ul>

<p>
This arguably leaves unclear just <i>who</i> is responsible for training the developer's personnel in the special safety procedures — as before, other portions of the construction agreement might shed light on the question, but that's not the ideal situation.
</p>

<p>
A useful business expression (albeit a bit trite from overuse) is <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/one_throat_to_choke">One Throat to Choke!</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Drafting lesson:</b> Even in cases where passive voice might be appropriate: Try not to leave any room for doubt about <i>who</i> is responsible for <i>making</i> Item X happen, or for <i>preventing</i> Event Y from happening. As a judge in New York City once opined: "The hallmark of good legal writing is that an intelligent layperson will understand it <b>on the first read</b>." <cite> Gerald Lebovits, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2970873">Free at Last from Obscurity: Achieving Clarity</a>, 96 Mich.

EXAMPLE: A large U.S. exporter of liquid natual gas (LNG) had to arbitrate whether a "start date" had occurred in a contract with Shell — if the start date had occurred, then the exporter would have been restricted in its ability to sell into spot markets at higher prices than under the contract. The problem was that the "start date" was tied to completion of a Louisiana liquefaction facility, and apparently it wasn't entirely clear whether "completion" had occurred. The exporter ended up winning the arbitration. <cite> See Press release, <a href="https://investors.ventureglobal.com/news/news-details/2025/Venture-Global-Statement-on-Shell-Arbitration-Decision/default.aspx">Venture Global Statement on Shell Arbitration Decision</a> (Aug. 12, 2025); Alistair Calvert, John Gilbert, and Adam Quigley, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/shell-v-venture-global-commissioning-a-3353535">Shell v Venture Global: Commissioning a Dispute</a> (Aug. 27, 2025). </cite>

<b>Lesson:</b> Be clear that a right or obligation does or doesn't start, or does or doesn't end.

<li><p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>McGinnis</i> (Ohio App. 2024), a tenant leased a house with an option to purchase; the relevant option language was as follows. The tenant didn't give notice by a stated date; the landlord concluded that the tenant's option to purchase had therefore expired. But the trial court and appellate court disagreed, because (they said) that point wasn't clear: "If the parties had intended for missing the June 1, 2021 deadline to result in termination of the purchase option, their agreement easily could have said so. But it did not." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8211742748971078351">McGinnis v. Conley</a>, 2024 Ohio 482 ¶ 16 (Ohio App.). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Lesson:</b> Likewise, don't write that notice must be "given" by a certain date; instead, say that notice must be "received" or "effective" (if effectiveness is defined) or "sent" by that date.

It's seldom if ever a good idea to start drafting a contract (or even just a clause) from scratch. That's especially true when you're relatively new at contract drafting.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Good clauses and forms will serve as a something like an operating manual for the parties' dealings, identifying what-if cases that can arise and providing instructions (or at least guidance) in how to handle those cases.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Even mediocre clauses and forms will serve as something of a checklist of issues that the drafter should consider addressing; that's important because we humans are all prone to overlooking "stupid stuff." (See the discussion of checklists at <a href="#chklist-cmt">34.5</a>.)

<h3 id="combat-barbie"><span class="section-number-3">30.26.</span> Combat Barbie: Consider using "distractor" terms</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-combat-barbie">
<p>
Military people learn early that when preparing for inspection, you don't want to make everything perfect. That's because the inspector will keep looking until he (or she) finds <i>something</i> — because if the inspector doesn't find anything, <i>his superior might wonder whether the inspector really did his job</i>.
</p>

<p>
The trick is instead to make everything pretty squared away — but then [mess] things up just a little bit. That way, <i>the inspector will have something to find</i> and report to his superior, thus avoiding questions whether the inspector <i>really</i> inspected.
</p>

<p>
Illustrating the point: In an online forum, a British lawyer, who had graduated from Sandhurst (the UK equivalent of West Point), told the following story, paraphrased here: At Sandhurst (as is also true at U.S. military academies), first-year cadets are hounded relentlessly by upper-class cadets during their first few weeks. One such first-year cadet, who was female, did a good job of squaring away her bunk and gear for inspection.
</p>

<p>
But then, before the inspection the cadet carefully placed a "Combat Barbie" doll on her bunk. Of course, when it came the cadet's turn to be inspected, the inspectors <i>immediately</i> noticed her egregious insult to good military order; they promptly began "counseling" her about the unmilitary appearance of her bunk area.
</p>

<p>
That played right into the cadet's hands: As it happened, the inspectors' "counseling" took up their entire alloted time for that cadet's inspection. And this saved the cadet quite a bit of trouble: Without the distracton of Combat Barbie, the inspectors might instead have used their time to trash the cadet's bunk area, leaving her gear strewn all over the floor, and ordering her to restore the environment as "additional training."
</p>

<p>
A similar "distractor" psychology can sometimes work in drafting a contract: Be sure to give the other side's reviewer <i>something</i> to ask to change, if for no other reason than to give the reviewer something to report to her boss or client as having been spotted and fixed, thanks to the reviewer's commendable diligence.
</p>

<p>
<i>But make it a fairly minor point</i>; otherwise, the reviewer and her client might dismiss you as naïve — and worse, they  might start to question whether <i>your</i> client was a suitable business partner.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> If you're a supplier, consider specifying payment terms of net-20 days, and be prepared to agree immediately to net-30 days if asked. But <i>don't</i> specify <i>net-5 days</i>, which in many situations would risk branding you as naive about "how things are done."
</p>

<h3 id="cons-defn"><span class="section-number-3">30.27.</span> Consultation in lieu of consent? <i>(notes)</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-cons-defn">
<p>
Sudden, unexpected moves by one party to a contract can make the other party nervous. Example: The business relationship between a service provider and a customer could be damaged if the service provider were to suddenly replace a key person assigned to the customer's work without advance notice. 
</p>

<p>
The usual, sledge-hammer approach to dealing with this problem is to contractually require the provider to obtain the customer's prior <i>consent</i> before taking such an action.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The provider, though, will usually push back against such a consent requirement — the provider will be reluctant to give the customer a veto over how it runs its business.</li>

<li>Moreover, it could be a management burden for the provider to have to check every customer's contract to see what internal management decisions required prior customer approval.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As an alternative (and compromise), the provider might be willing to commit to <i>consulting</i> with the customer before taking a specified action that could cause heart­burn for the customer. That way, the customer would at least get notice, perhaps an explanation, and an opportunity to be heard, which could make a big difference in the customer's reaction and to the parties' business relationship.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A services contract could say that, for example, "Except in cases of emergency, Service Provider will consult with Customer at least ten business days in advance of replacing Service Provider's supervisor in charge of the Project." That would at least get the parties talking to one another, which can help avoid strains in their business relationship.
</p>

<p>
Of course, a party would also have to keep track of its <i>consultation</i> commitments, just as much as for its <i>consent</i> obligations.

<div id="outline-container-demon-exhib" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="demon-exhib"><span class="section-number-3">30.28.</span> Demonstrative exhibits: Build them into the contract?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-demon-exhib">
<p>
Remember the cliché about a picture being worth a thousand words? Nowhere is that more true than the courtroom. That's why in litigation, lawyers and expert witnesses often use so-called demonstrative exhibits — diagrams, time lines, charts, tables, sketches, etc., on posters or PowerPoint slides — as teaching aids to help them get their points across to the jury during testimony and argument.
</p>

<p>
In a lawsuit, the jurors might or might not be allowed to refer to the parties' demonstrative aids while they're deliberating. 
</p>

<p>
•  Jurors normally take "real" exhibits — like a copy of the contract in suit — into the jury room with them and refer to them during deliberations.
</p>

<p>
• To be sure: In U.S. federal-court cases, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_1006">Rule 1006</a> of the Federal Rules of Evidence does allow lawyer-prepared summaries and the like to be admitted into evidence. <cite> See, e.g., Allen Hinderaker & Ian McFarland, <a href="https://www.merchantgould.com/News-Room/Articles/85803/Demonstrative-Evidence-Under-the-Rules-The-Admissable-and-Inadmissable">Demon&shy;stra&shy;tive Evidence Under the Rules: The Admissable and Inadmissable</a> (MerchantGould.com 2015), <i>discussing</i> Fed. R. Evid. 611 and 1006. </cite>
</p>

<p>
•  Judges, however, sometimes won't allow the jury to take demonstrative exhibits with them, on the theory that the jurors are supposed to decide the case on the basis of the "real" evidence and not on documents created solely for litigation by the lawyers. 
</p>

<p>
And trial judges have significant discretion over evidentiary matters: In any given trial, if the judge were to decide that a particular demonstrative aid <i>shouldn't</i> be given to the jury for use in its deliberations, that'd normally the end of that discussion. EXAMPLE: When Netflix was sued for infringing a patent, Netflix's lawyers created a demonstrative exhibit to use for cross-examining the patent owner's expert witness. Netflix tried to get the demonstrative exhibit admitted into evidence, but the trial court sustained the patent owner's objection and refused to allow it. (Netflix ultimately defeated the patent owner's infringement case — but only on appeal. <cite> See <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/cafc/24-1669/24-1669-2026-02-09.pdf?ts=1770652991">GoTV Streaming, LLC v. Netflix, Inc.</a>, No. 24-1669, slip op. at 9 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 9, 2026). </cite>) So: If you plan ahead when drafting a contract, your client's trial counsel might later be able to sneak a demonstrative aid or two into the jury room through the back door — no, through the front door, but at the back of the contract — <i>as "real" evidence, not just as a demonstrative exhibit</i>, to help the jurors understand what the parties agreed to.
</p>

<p>
Ask yourself: <i>Is there anything we'd want the jurors to have tacked up on the wall in the jury room</i> — for example, a time line of a complex set of obligations? If so, think about creating that time line now, and including it as an exhibit to the contract. The exhibit will ordinarily count as part of the "real" evidence; it should normally be allowed back into the jury room without a fuss.
</p>

<p>
Of course, before the contract is signed the parties would have to agree to include your stealth demonstrative exhibit in the contract document. But their reviewing your exhibit for correctness could be a worthwhile exercise — and if their review makes them realize they don't agree about something, it's usually better if they find that out before they sign.
</p>

<p>
And to be sure, there's always the risk of unintended consequences: The demonstrative exhibit you create today might not create the impression you want to create in a jury room years from now. But that's always a risk even when you write the contract itself.
</p>

<p>
Your time line, chart, summary, diagram, etc., doesn't necessarily have to be a separate exhibit: modern word processors make it simple to include such things as insets within the body of the contract. (I used to do just that decades ago when writing patent-invalidity or -noninfringement opinions, a.k.a. "freedom to operate" or "FTO" opinions, for clients: I'd prepare the PowerPoint slides that I'd want to use if I were testifying as an expert witness, and then I'd insert those slides as insets in the body of the opinion itself. Happily, none of those opinions were ever the subject of litigation, at least so far as I know. )

<h3 id="nl-conf-from-3pty"><span class="section-number-3">30.29.</span> Confirmations – get from third party? <i>(notes)</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-conf-from-3pty">
<p>
Getting confirmation from an independent source relates to the principle that you get what you INspect, not what you EXpect, as discussed at <a href="#r-inspections-clause">13.4</a>.
</p>

<p>
When two parties enter into a contract — let's call them "Fred" and "Ginger" — they might want independent confirmation of information provided by the other party, instead of taking the other party's word for it.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Suppose that under the contract, Ginger is supposed to arrange for a third party, "Harry," to provide one or more benefits for Fred if Fred so requests —  such as, for example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Harry's guaranty to pay Fred what Ginger owes him if Ginger doesn't pay on time;</li>

<li>an insurance policy (see <a href="#nl-insurance-notes">28.24</a>) to support Ginger's indemnity obligation;</li>

<li>a <a href="https://www.irmi.com/term/insurance-definitions/payment-bond">payment bond</a>, under which Harry agrees to pay Ginger's subcontractors if Ginger fails to pay them, so that the subcontractors won't put a lien on Fred's property.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that situation, suppose that, in due course, Ginger reports to Fred that yes, she has indeed made the necessary arrangements with Harry to provide Fred with the agreed benefit. 
</p>

<p>
Should Fred take Ginger's word for it?  Quite possibly not; it might be better for the contract to require Ginger to get <i>Harry</i> to confirm to Fred, in writing, that Ginger has in fact made the necessary arrangements. Otherwise:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ginger might neglect to make such arrangements with Harry; that could leave Fred stuck without the benefits that Harry was supposed to provide him — for example, without insurance to cover Ginger's indemnity obligation if Ginger didn't have the money to do so herself.</li>

<li>Worse: If Ginger is a shady character, she might be tempted to lie — to state falsely that she had made the arrangements with Harry — or even to provide Fred with a forged- or otherwise-fraudulent confirmation, purportedly from Harry.</li>

<li>The law might give Fred more rights against Harry if <i>Harry</i> provides Fred with confirmation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This concern is reflected in some Lighthouse provisions such as the following (possibly among others):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>§ <a href="#audit-copy-to-rkpr">9.1.17</a> of Protocol <a href="#r-audit-proto">9.1</a> states that after an audit, the recordkeeper is entitled to get a copy of the auditor's report directly from the auditor.</li>

<li>§ <a href="#notice-3r">2.8.9</a> of Protocol <a href="#r-notices-rule">2.8</a> (notices) requires independent confirmation of receipt of notice in most cases.</li>

<li>The legend will help the client's litigation counsel to spot documents that should be withheld from production to avoid waiver of the privilege (see above).</li>

<h3 id="nl-ch-ins"><span class="section-number-3">30.31.</span> Cheap insurance in drafting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-ch-ins">
<p>
"Cheap insurance" is a metaphor for small, <i>low-cost</i> habits or actions that might never pay off — but that can help avoid big problems later. An example from everyday life is when you get home, putting your keys in the same place every time, to reduce the chances that you'll forget where you put them. As a character in a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel said: "These dull habits sometimes pay off." <cite> Herman Wouk, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368772.The_Caine_Mutiny">The Caine Mutiny</a>, ch. 10. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Here are a few contract-drafting examples:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Try not to leave big blank spaces on a page of a contract, in case an unscrupulous person later uses one of those blank spaces to insert additional details that weren't agreed to. Sure, maybe you can later prove the forgery, but it might well be better to use a guardrail clause (or, more crudely: apply some schmuck repellent).
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Consider putting the word <b>WAIVE</b> and its variations (waives, waived, waiver, etc.) in bold-face all caps, in case a jurisdiction requires it for conspicuousness (<a href="#waiv-conspi-c">3.11.6.1</a>).
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Consider whether to include "for the avoidance of doubt" clauses as a guardrail against "creative" contract interpretations, e.g., concerning assignment consent at discretion (Option <a href="#assmt-cons-discr">17.3.6.1</a>). BUT: Consider also whether including such a clause would "poke the bear" — causing the other side to notice and insist on rewording in a manner <i>not</i> to your liking (see <a href="#poke-bear">30.14</a>).
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> Don't go overboard — that's how contract forms grow, and grow, and grow &#x2026;. Remember that people will have to read everything you add to a contract. Don't turn your contract into shovelware.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-learn-bus">
<p>
Clients expect their contracts to reflect some foresight about a reasonable set of what-if contingencies. They <i>love</i> it when their lawyers know the business as well as the law. And one of the big complaints clients have about lawyers (especially junior ones) is that "they just don't understand the business!" 
</p>

<p>
But it seldom works for a client or senior lawyer to say: <i>Learn the business, kid!</i> Um: How, exactly? 
</p>

<p>
Nor is it productive to add, <i>Just ask questions!</i> — because it might not be obvious what questions should be asked.
</p>

<p>
<b>"Be a hitter, Johnny!" isn't helpful:</b> Here's an analogy: In the 1990s, I helped coach my son's Little League baseball teams. In the early years of tee-ball played by six-year-olds, I'd sometimes hear a mom in the bleachers shouting "<i>Be a hitter, Johnny!</i>" when her little boy came up to bat.  (And yes, and it was pretty much always moms doing this from the bleachers, not dads.)
</p>

<p>
But "be a hitter!" isn't actionable advice. What little Johnny really needs is to be coached in what to <i>do</i>: Hold the bat this way. Plant your feet that way. And so on. 
</p>

<p>
With that in mind: This book tries to show  chapter presents a series of questions, with handy mnemonic acronyms, to help contract professionals and their clients:

EXAMPLE: Some years ago, late-night host Stephen Colbert — and his agent — showed that there's more to contract drafting than just putting words on the page. This was back when Colbert, as his "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert_(character)">character</a>," was hosting the Comedy Central show that made him famous, <i>The Colbert Report</i>. 
</p>

<p>
When Colbert's contract with Comedy Central was up for renewal, he and his agent apparently negotiated to have successive contract terms expire at the same time as David Letterman's contracts with CBS. That way, if Letterman ever decided to retire, Colbert would be able to leave his existing show and throw his hat in the ring to take over Letterman's <i>The Late Show</i> on CBS. And of course that's just what happened: By prior planning, Colbert was able to seize an important opportunity, instead of remaining tied up by an existing contract. <cite> See Bill Carter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/business/media/stephen-colbert-to-succeed-letterman-on-late-show.html">Colbert Will Host ‘Late Show,' Playing Himself for a Change</a>, New York Times, Apr. 11, 2014, at A1. </cite>

<p>
Assuming away problems (a.k.a. wishful thinking) can be dangerous. But some people are prone to it — including business people. Contract negotiators should keep this in mind in brainstorming scenarios and action plans.
</p>

<p>
<i>Example: Where will the money come from?</i>  When drafting a critical contract obligation for the other side — for example, an indemnity obligation — consider imposing additional requirements to be sure that there's money <i>somewhere</i> to fund the obligation, such as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>an insurance policy;</li>
<li>a third-party guaranty;</li>
<li>a letter of credit from a bank or other financial institution;</li>
<li>or even taking a security interest in collateral that could be seized and sold to raise funds.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Apropos of wishful thinking, there's an old joke about economists that seems to have been first published in 1970:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A physicist, a chemist, and an economist are shipwrecked on a desert island. They have nothing to eat and get very hungry.</li>
<li>A pallet full of cans of food washes up on the beach. But our castaways have nothing to use to open the food cans.</li>
<li>The physicist and the chemist each propose ways of opening the cans: Dropping them from a coconut tree; heating them in a fire till they explode; and the like.</li>
<li>The economist has a simpler solution: "We'll assume</li>
</ul>
<p>
we have a can opener." <cite> See Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assume_a_can_opener">Assume a can opener</a>, <i>quoting</i> Kenneth E. Boulding, Economics as a Science at 101 (McGraw-Hill 1970). </cite>

Berkshire Hathaway's late vice-chairman Charles Munger famously said, "Never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes a little further my appreciation of incentive superpower. * * * Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives." <cite> Charles T.

</p>

<p>
When drafting a contract, it can pay dividends to give some thought to how to manage the so-called "agency costs" that can arise from these personal interests and incentives of individual players. That's because when disputes arise, the involved individuals will naturally want to protect their own interests, such as: • not having fingers pointed at them; • being thought of by their side as a committed team player who's willing to fight to win, not a defeatist who throws in the towel; • protecting their bonus, their commission, their pay raise, their promotion, etc. <cite> See generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_cost">Agency cost</a> (Wikipedia.org); a somewhat more-readable presentation is at <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencycosts.asp">Agency Costs</a> (Investopedia.com). </cite>
</p>

<p>
These desires can manifest themselves in a variety of ways; a skilled contract drafter will try to help the client channel these incentives — on both sides — and manage individuals' expectations and incentives.

<h3 id="top-spin"><span class="section-number-3">31.4.</span> T O P   S P I N    S N O T S:  Identifying threats and opportunities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-top-spin">
<p>
The acronym T O P   S P I N can help planners to identify threats and opportunities of potential interest. (The acronym is inspired by the business concept of SWOT analysis, standing for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.)
</p>

<p>
The first part of the acronym, T O P, refers to the <b>threats</b> and <b>opportunities</b> that can arise in the course of the different <b>phases</b> of the parties' business relationship — those phases can themselves be remembered with the acronym <b>S N O T S</b>: Startup; Normal Operations; Trouble; and Shutdown.
</p>

<p>
The second part of the acronym, S P I N, reminds us that various threats and opportunities can be presented by one or more of the following:
</p>

<p>
• S: The participants in the respective <b>supply chains</b> in which the contracting parties participate, both as suppliers and as customers, direct and indirect. If the parties are "Alice" and "Bob," then we can think of Alice's and Bob's respective supply chains as forming a capital letter H, as illustrated below.
</p>


<figure id="org3cb8464">
<img src="./img/INDIA-TILT-WHALER-H-diagram.png" alt="A block capital letter H with the word &quot;Contract&quot; in the center, &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; in the left-center and right-center of the H; on each of the vertical arms of the H,  &quot;Supplier,&quot; &quot;Supplier's supplier,&quot; &quot;Customer's customer&quot;; outside of each vertical arm of the H, the words &quot;Interveners&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot;" class="photowidth80C">

</figure>

<p>
• P: The individual <b>people</b> involved in the supply chains — all of whom have their own personal motivations and interests.
</p>

<p>
• I: <b>Interveners</b> such as competitors; alliance partners; unions; governmental actors such as elected officials, regulators, taxing authorities, and law enforcement; the press; and acquirers. Don't forget the <i>individual people</i> associated with an intervener, all of whom will have personal desires, motives, and interests.
</p>

<p>
• N: <b>Nature</b>, which can cause all kinds of threats and opportunities to arise in a contract relationship. EXAMPLE: As of this writing, Google Scholar shows <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%2Bcovid+%2B%22force+majeure%22&hl=en&as_sdt=6%2C44&as_ylo=2020&as_yhi=">more than 500 reported court opinions</a> involving force-majeure issues and the COVID-19 pandemic.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-india-tilt">
<p>
Once planners have compiled a list of threats and opportunities of interest, they should think about the specific actions that might be desirable — or perhaps specific actions to be prohibited ­— when a particular threat or opportunity <i>appears</i> to be arising. Many such actions will fall into the following categories:
</p>

<p>
• I: <b>Information</b> to gather about the situation in question;
</p>

<p>
• N: <b>Notification</b> of others that the threat or opportunity is (or might be) arising. Refer to the SPIN part of the TOP SPIN acronym above for suggestions about players who might be appropriate to notify.
</p>

<p>
• D:  <b>Diagnosis</b>, i.e., confirmation that the particular threat or opportunity is real, as opposed to being an example of some other phenomenon (or just a false alarm).
</p>

<p>
• I: <b>Immediate</b> <i>action,</i> e.g., to mitigate the threat or to seize the opportunity.
</p>

<p>
• A: <b>Additional</b> <i>actions</i>, e.g., to remediate adverse effects or take advantage of the opportunity.
</p>

<p>
ICE-CREAM EXAMPLE:  Consumers have been known to become ill, and a few have died, after eating ice cream that, during manufacturing, became contaminated with listeria bacteria. The grocery store's planners might want to use the I N D I A checklist to specify in some detail how the ice-cream manufacturer is to respond to such reports, with requirements for notifying the grocery store; product recalls; and so on.
</p>

<p>
Some plans are likely to require advance preparation. Planners can use the T I L T part of the acronym to decide whether any of the following might be appropriate:
</p>

<p>
• T:  Acquisition of <b>tools</b> — such as equipment, information, consumables, etc. — for responding to the threat or opportunity.
</p>

<p>
• I:  Acquisition of <b>insurance</b> (or other backup sources of funding).
</p>

<p>
• L: Posting of a <b>lookout</b>, that is, putting in place a monitoring system to detect the threat or opportunity in question.
</p>

<p>
• T:  <b>Training</b> of the people and organizations who might be called on to respond to the threat or opportunity.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-whaler-plans">
<p>
In specifying actions to be taken, planners will often want to go into more detail than just the traditional 5W + H acronym (standing for Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How). Planners can do this using the acronym W H A L E R:
</p>

<p>
• W:  <b>Who</b> is to take (or might take, or must not take) the action.
</p>

<p>
• H:  <b>How</b> the action is to be taken, e.g., in accordance with a specified industry standard.
</p>

<p>
• A:  <b>Autonomy</b> of the actor in deciding whether to take or not take the action.  Depending on the circumstances, this might be:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No autonomy:  The action in question is either mandatory or prohibited, with nothing in between.</li>

<li>Total autonomy:  For the action in question, the specified actor has sole and unfettered discretion as to whether to take the action.</li>

<li>Partial autonomy:  The decision to take (or not take) the action must meet one or more requirements such as:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reasonableness — be careful: that can be complicated and expensive to litigate;</li>

<li>Good faith — ditto;</li>

<li>Notification of some other player, before the fact and/or after the fact;</li>

<li>Consultation with some other player before the fact; or</li>

<li>Consent of some other player (but is consent not to be unreasonably withheld?  A claim of unreasonable withholding of consent could itself be one more thing to litigate.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
• L:  <b>Limitations</b> on the action — for example, minimums or maximums as to one or more of time; place; manner; money; and people.
</p>

<p>
• E:  <b>Economics</b> of the action, such as required payment actions (each of which can get its own W H A L E R analysis), and backup funding sources.
</p>

<p>
• R:  <b>Recordkeeping</b> concerning the action in question (with its own W H A L E R analysis).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-31-7">
<p>
A more-complicated approach to identifying and planning for risks is the so-called "bow tie" method, developed by oil-and-gas giant Shell and later adopted in other industries. <cite> See, e.g., the detailed explanation (with examples) in Julian Talbot, <a href="https://www.juliantalbot.com/post/risk-bow-tie-method">Risk BowTie Method</a> (JulianTalbot.com 2020), archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/ATN7-FGAU">https://perma.cc/ATN7-FGAU</a>; see also the Hacker News discussion at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24130809">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24130809</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
The bowtie method of diagramming risks and consequences is reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram">Feynman diagrams</a> in the world of physics. <cite> See generally, e.g., Frank Wilczek, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-feynman-diagrams-are-so-important-20160705/">How Feynman Diagrams Almost Saved Space</a> (QuantaMagazine.org 2016).

When I was a junior lawyer at Arnold, White & Durkee, I worked a lot with partner Mike Sutton. One of the many things Mike taught me was that when interviewing or deposing a witness, a useful, all-purpose question consists of just two words:  <b>Anything else?</b>

<p>
That same question can likewise help contract planners get some comfort that they've covered the possibilities that should be addressed in a draft agreement.

<p>
The author of a popular contract style manual once opined — <i>wrongly</i> — that, apart from the opening recitals, "in a contract you don’t reason or explain. You just state rules." <cite> Ken Adams, <a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/therefore/">More Words Not to Include in a Contract— “Therefore” and Its Relatives</a>, at <a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/therefore/">http://www.adamsdrafting.com/therefore/</a> (2008). </cite>
</p>

<p>
That view would be fine — if it weren't for a few inconvenient facts:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Even in a business-to-business contract, it's <i>people</i>, not computers, who carry out obligations and exercise contract rights. Computers do <i>exactly</i> as they're told, but people? Not so much — at least not always reliably. <i>(Note: So-called digital "smart contracts" are a very-different thing.)</i></li>

<li>People can forget (sometimes "conveniently") what was agreed to before. This can be especially true when individuals' <i>personal</i> incentives — which often are hidden — are involved (see <a href="#personal-incentive">31.3</a>).</li>

<li>As time goes on, people (and thus parties) can change their minds about what they regard important. "Buyer's remorse" is just one example of this phenomenon.</li>

<li>A contracting party's circumstances can change after the contract is signed. If that happens, the party might want (or desperately <i>need</i>) to back out of the deal — see, e.g., Elon Musk's unsuccessful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk#Attempted_termination">attempt to abandon his agreement</a> to acquire Twitter.</li>

<li>The people who originally negotiated the business terms might not be in the same jobs. Their successors might not know why the parties agreed to the terms that they did. And again, the successors might have a different view of what's important and which obligations to honor.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-32-1-2">
<p>
The upshot: The <i>people</i> who will carry out a contract will sometimes need to be reminded — or even persuaded — to do the specific things called for by a contract. (Examples and explanations, see <a href="#eg-sample">22.21.4.1</a>, possibly stated in footnotes, see <a href="#fns">30.20</a>, can serve as useful reminders on that score.)
</p>

<p>
To be sure, the famous Strunck & White drafting guide counsels writers to "omit needless words." But the operative word there is <i>needless</i>. The contract drafter's mission includes helping remind the parties what they agreed to — and if necessary, to help persuade them to act accordingly. Sometimes, a few extra words of explanation in a contract can help.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-32-1-3">
<p>
Let's not forget another important group of future readers: Judges, jurors, and arbitrators will sometimes be asked to enforce a contract in a lawsuit or arbitration. The vast majority of contracts never see the inside of a courtroom, but drafters <i>must</i> think about the possibility — again, without going overboard or putting the client in the position of being scared of its own shadow.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Clarity is the first criterion: It's much easier for a court to grant an early motion to dismiss a bogus contract claim if the contract language itself refutes the claim. <i>[DCT TO DO: Pick an example.]</i> Likewise, if a contract clearly states that <i>A</i> must take Action X, and <i>A</i> doesn't do so, then a court is more likely to grant at least partial summary judgment on liability.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Tone can be a factor: Like all of us, judges and jurors can be influenced by what they think is "fair." Sometimes, the <i>phrasing</i> of a contract's terms can make a difference in how judges and jurors react to the parties and to the positions they're taking. (We'll see examples during the semester.)
</p>

<p>
For both clarity and tone, sometimes a few extra words can pay off. How much is "a few" is a matter of judgment to be addressed case-by-case — when in doubt, <a href="#partn-r">Ask the Partner!</a> (<a href="#partn-r">32.10</a>).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-serv-rdr">

#+begin_quote The hallmark of good legal writing is that an intelligent layperson will understand it on the first read. #+end_quot <cite> Judge Gerald Lebovits, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2970873">Free at Last from Obscurity: Achieving Clarity</a>, 96 Mich.

</p>


<p>
"To serve the <i>client</i>, serve the <i>reader</i>!" should be The Great Rule of All Legal Writing — keeping mind that clients on both sides of the table would often prefer not to be reading the contract at all: They have other things on their minds — such as getting the deal "done" and moving on to other matters — and so they're frequently <i>un</i>-fond of having to spend time on reading the "legalese" terms and conditions.
</p>

<p>
Contracts written in dense legalese are less effective at educating or persuading readers — and those are two key missions of every contract drafter. But who <i>is</i> the reader? There are many possibilities — both now and in the future:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>business people who need to get up to speed for negotiating the contract;</li>
<li>business people who have to carry out the contract's obligations — and those might not be the same business people who were involved in the contract negotiation, so they might well be reading the contract "cold";</li>
<li>lawyers for one or both parties, possibly new to representing their respective clients;</li>
<li>(unfortunately sometimes:) judges and jurors.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Apropos of that last point: Certainly the vast majority of contracts never see the inside of a courtroom. But it can't hurt to do some little things to plan for that possibility, as long as it won't increase costs or delay getting to signature, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Courts are more likely to enforce clear terms. EXAMPLE: A former employee sued a company — <i>after</i> having signed a severance agreement that included release language. The court granted the company's motion for judgment on the pleadings, noting that "[t]he Agreement is stated in clear and unmistakable terms that are understandable to the average individual. Accordingly, the release is enforceable &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10254465733654708162">Makarevich v. USI Ins. Services, LLC</a>, No. 1:25-cv-10434-JEK, part I, slip op. (D. Mass. Jul. 14) (granting judgment on the pleadings against <i>pro se</i> former employee, but with leave to amend as to any post-release claims) (emphasis added); see also <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14083590545926761647">order of dismissal</a> (Aug. 5, 2025). </cite></li>
<li>Trial counsel prefer plain language in a contract, because plain language offers better "sound bites" for trial exhibits and for use in cross-examining witnesses.</li>

<li>Plain contract language can help guide the jury in jury deliberations because <b>the contract will normally be part of the "real" evidence</b> in the record that the jury gets to review — the same won't always be true of trial counsel's demonstrative exhibits (summaries, PowerPoint slides, etc.) that the judge might <i>or might not</i> allow to be taken back into the jury room.</li>

<p>
Surely you've read contract provisions that are written as long, tangled skeins of legalese. Let's call them "spaghetti clauses." 
</p>

<p>
(In the software world, "spaghetti code" is a mildly-contemptuous epithet for unstructured, hard-to-maintain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code">source code</a> for computer programs, sometimes also known as "rat's nests" or "big balls of mud," as opposed to more-modular "ravioli code" or "macaroni code.") <cite> See generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">Spaghetti code</a> (Wikipedia.org). </cite>
</p>

<p>
As an example: Just glance at the following <i>two-sentence</i> excerpt from an airline merger agreement — 309 words in the first sentence and 64 words in the second one:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[4.3] (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Continental nor the consummation by Continental of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Continental with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, will[:] (i) assuming (solely in the case of the Merger) that the Continental Stockholder Approval is obtained, violate any provision of the Continental Charter or the Continental Bylaws or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 4.4 are duly obtained and/or made, (A) violate [x] any Injunction or, [y] assuming (solely in the case of the Merger) that the Continental Stockholder Approval is obtained, any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree applicable to Continental, any of the Continental Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or (B) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancelation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of Continental or any of the Continental Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, Continental License, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Continental or any of the Continental Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, in the case of clause (ii), for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, rights of termination or cancelation, accelerations or Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Continental. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the date of this Agreement, Continental is not a party to, or subject to, any standstill agreement or similar agreement that restricts any Person from engaging in negotiations or discussions with Continental or from acquiring, or making any tender offer or exchange offer for, any equity securities issued by Continental or any Continental Voting Debt. <cite> From <a href="https://tinyurl.com/UAL-CAL">https://tinyurl.com/UAL-CAL</a> (SEC.gov); bracketed lettering added — not that it helps much.

<p>
This isn't just a question of aesthetic taste: The harder it is to read and understand a draft contract:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the longer it will take — and the more it will cost — for the parties to review (certainly), revise (probably), and sign it; and</li>

<li>the greater the odds that a future reader might "misunderstand" the language — perhaps intentionally so.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sssp-scan" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sssp-scan"><span class="section-number-4">32.3.2.</span> Go for scanability: One substantive point per short paragraph</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-sssp-scan">
<p>
Each paragraph in a contract should be short AND address a single point that might require significant discussion. If that means spinning off some of the draft verbiage into separate paragraphs, then so be it.  Other things being equal:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Short paragraphs are easier for The Other Side to review. That will help speed up getting the contract to signature, which your client will almost always appreciate. (It might also earn your client just a bit of goodwill from The Other Side.)</li>

<li>Short paragraphs are better workaday tools for business managers, and, if necessary someday, for trial counsel and judges.</li>

<li>In the future, short paragraphs can be more-easily copied and pasted into a different contract without inadvertently messing up some other clause.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a federal-government <a href="https://digital.gov/guides/plain-language/writing/clear-short#content-start">plain language guide</a> explains:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Short paragraphs are easier to read and understand. Long paragraphs can discourage users from trying to understand your material. 
</p>

<p>
* * *
</p>

<p>
There is nothing wrong with an occasional one-sentence paragraph.
</p>

<p>
Using short paragraphs is an ideal way to open up your writing and create white space. In turn, this makes your writing more inviting and easier to read. &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
* * *
</p>

<p>
Limit each paragraph or section to one topic. This makes it easier for your audience to understand your information. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that captures the essence of everything in the paragraph.
</p>

<p>
Putting each topic in a separate paragraph makes your information easier to digest.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So: Do this when drafting a contract:
</p>

<p>
1.  Write as many <i>short</i> sentences and paragraphs — "sound bites," if you will —  as are needed to cover the subject.
</p>

<p>
2.  If a sentence starts to run too long for easy reading — and we all do it — then <b>break it up</b>. Do likewise for run-on paragraphs. 
</p>

<p>
Students: In our Contract Drafting course we'll do a number of in-class exercises where you'll work together in small groups to break up some real-world spaghetti clauses. 
</p>

<p>
Even if the resulting draft happens to take up a few extra pages, your client likely will thank you for it.
</p>

<p>
To be sure: Short paragraphs weren't always welcome: In the days when contracts were printed out in hard copy, many lawyers intentionally used a "compressed" format — narrow margins, long paragraphs,  small print — so as to fit on fewer pieces of paper. 
</p>

<p>
But those days are long gone. Nowadays, pretty much everyone reviews and even signs contracts on a screen, not on paper. So the page length is far less important to negotiation than the readability of the text.

<div id="outline-container-thik-why" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="thik-why"><span class="section-number-4">32.3.3.</span> Background: <i>Why</i> do lawyers draft spaghetti clauses?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-thik-why">
<p>
<b>A holdover from lawyers dictating to secretaries?</b> In traditionally-drafted contracts, the spaghetti-clause style (see <a href="#thik-cls">32.3.1</a>) might well have come from the way lawyers drafted contracts, letters, etc., in the days before desktop computers and word-processing software. 
</p>

<p>
When I was a brand-new lawyer, I knew a couple of ancient attorneys — or at least I thought they were ancient; I'm probably older now than they were then — who still dictated contract language to a secretary:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
The secretary would take down the lawyer's words on a stenographer's pad, often using Pitman or Gregg <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand">shorthand</a>. 
</p>

<p>
(Sometimes the attorney would instead use a tape recorder such as a Dictaphone and give the tape to the secretary to type up.)
</p></li>

<li>If in mid-dictation the lawyer was struck by a new thought, he might well say, "semicolon; provided, however, that &#x2026;."</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The secretary would type up the lawyer's dictation on a typewriter — generally with no memory features, and likely with "flimsies" (carbon paper sets) to make additional copies.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Any editing of typed drafts had to be done with <a href="https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.107762.html">typewriter erasers</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wite-Out">Wite-Out</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Paper">Liquid Paper</a> correction fluid.</li>

<li>Retyping was time-consuming and costly; you really didn't want to have to do it if you could avoid it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So it's easy to see how spaghetti paragraphs came to be regarded as acceptable, even as a standard of practice. Ditto for  "provided, however" interruptions in spaghetti paragraphs.
</p>

<p>
In the modern era, though: While anyone might sometimes draft a spaghetti clause, there's no excuse for leaving it that way instead of breaking up the clause into shorter sound bites. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Too busy?</b> Another possible explanation comes from famed French sage Blaise Pascal, paraphrased in English as: "If I'd had more time, I'd have shortened this letter." <cite> Blaise Pascal, Lettre XVI, in Lettres provinciales, Letter XVI (Thomas M'Crie trans. 1866) (1656), available at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/PascalLetterXVI">https://tinyurl.com/PascalLetterXVI</a> (WikiSource.org). </cite>
</p>

<p>
(That paraphrase is itself a simplification of Pascal's original, which could be translated as, "I made this-here <i>[letter]</i> longer because I haven't had the leisure to make it shorter.")
</p>

<p>
Like Pascal, contract drafters are usually time-constrained, having to juggle multiple projects. So they often don't really think about whether they're hurting their clients' interests by making their work less-readable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution: Is a L.O.A.D. trying to sneak in an unfavorable term?</b> For some spaghetti clauses, there might be a less-innocent explanation: Is it possible that a L.O.A.D. — a Lazy Or Arrogant Drafter — was secretly hoping to use the MEGO factor ("Mine Eyes Glaze Over") to sneak an objectionable term past the other party's contract reviewer? This actually happens sometimes. For example, in the estimable redline.net forum (for lawyers only, membership required):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.redline.net/queries/short-single-topic-contract-paragraphs-speed-legal-review-0">A lawyer recounted</a> how he once represented a novice writer who was looking for an agent, to help the writer deal with publishers, etc.</li>

<li>One agency expressed interest in representing the writer and sent over a contract for the writer to sign.</li>

<li>But: Buried in a long paragraph was language to the effect that any work that the writer produced while the agency was representing the writer would be owned by the agency (!!!), not the writer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The lawyer naturally advised the writer, "DO NOT SIGN." 
</p>

<p>
<b>Is the drafter trying to feel more important?</b> Some less-secure lawyers might imagine that by using dense legalese, they'll enhance their personal prestige as High Priests of the Legal Profession, privvy to secret legal knowledge that's out of ordinary mortals' reach. That seems a dubious proposition at best — and indeed a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/risible">risible</a> one.

Let's take a stab at converting the above spaghetti paragraph into short-BLUF format:
</p>

Researchers at MIT conducted an experimental study (led by a career-changing Harvard law graduate) of legalese comprehension. The study's results pointed to a chief villain in legalese: "<b>center-embedded clauses</b>" — i.e., sentences and paragraphs where the action verb is buried in a <a href="#sssp">spaghetti paragraph</a> (see <a href="#sssp">32.3</a>). The researchers found that such clauses "inhibited recall to <i>[an even]</i> greater degree than other features" such as jargon and passive voice. <cite> <a href="https://law-ai.org/team/eric-martinez/">Eric Martínez</a>, Francis Mollica, and Edward Gibson, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722000580?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8c6198f0ae9945f3">Poor writing, not specialized concepts, drives processing difficulty in legal language</a>, <i>Cognition</i> (2022). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-32-7-1">
<p>
Another readability gotcha: Don't assume that word-processing software will reliably update a document's "automatic" internal cross-references between sections when editing the document to add new sections.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The original, correct cross-reference is,  "See section 14.3" <i>(where the number 14.3 is inserted by the software to match the section number)</i>.</li>

<li>During editing, a new section is added between section 8 and section 9.</li>

<li>This means that section 14.3 should now be section 15.3 — but <b>don't count on it.</b> (See below for a real-life example where a similar occurrence changed the course of a court case.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
That's one reason why this book is <span class="underline">not</span> written in Microsoft Word — but perhaps things are different now than when I started this project several years ago &#x2026;.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-32-7-2">
<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Delaware contract lawsuit, a pair of screwed-up cross-references in the contract led to major problems for the parties. One of the parties — the father of another party — had signed the contract only for purposes of two, referenced sections of the contract — including "Section 7.5." Unfortunately for Dad, there <span class="underline">was</span> no Section 7.5 in the contract. So, the court deferred until trial the question of Dad's liability under the contract — meaning that Dad would have to incur the expense, burden, and uncertainty of trying the case. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3234303283417898562">Labyrinth, Inc. v. Urich</a>, No. 2023-0327, part II.B.2, slip op. at text accompanying nn.248, 255 (Del. Ch. Jan. 25, 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The screwed-up cross-references also hurt the <i>plaintiff</i> — one of them led to the court's refusing to grant preliminary injunctive relief against the son-defendant for allegedly breaching a noncompetition covenant. <cite> <i>See id.</i> at part II.C, text accompanying n.261. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Great: More expense and uncertainty for all concerned, because the drafters (presumably) relied on word-processing software to update their cross-references — which <i>shouldn't</i> be a problem, but there you go.  (Hat tip: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-dedon/">Matthew Dedon</a>, who posted <a href="https://www.redline.net/queries/failure-check-those-section-references-can-be-costly-your-client">an alert</a> at the invaluable lawyer site <a href="https://www.redline.net/">redline.net</a>.)

<h3 id="intro-stdnt"><span class="section-number-3">32.8.</span> Looking ahead to the Age of AI</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-intro-stdnt">
<p>
Computer programs known as artificial intelligence, or "AI," are doing more contract drafting <i>and</i> contract review. And it's not just lawyers who are using AIs: It can be a lot less expensive for a client to have an AI generate a contract, or to review another party's contract draft, than to pay a lawyer to do it. For an everyday&#x2011; or low-impact transaction, the client might well decide that this is an acceptable business risk. (I've begun to see glimpses of this in my own part-time law practice.)
</p>

<p>
This increasing use of AIs presents some challenges for law schools and law firms:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>AI programs require human oversight, because those programs can sometimes "hallucinate." For example: In the courtroom arena, numerous lawyers have found themselves in trouble because they submitted AI-drafted briefs contaning bogus citations.<sup><a id="fnr.AISanctions" class="footref" href="#fn.AISanctions" role="doc-backlink">45</a></sup> This famously includes President Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen when he (Cohen) sought a reduction in his prison sentence and supervised release. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=736441032202744720">United States v. Cohen</a>, 724 F. Supp. 3d 251 (S.D.N.Y. 2024) (declining to impose sanctions on Cohen and his attorney for submitting "fake" case citations obtained by Cohen using Google Bard). </cite></li>
<li>Oversight requires experience. For many lawyers, that experience came over years of repeated drafting, reviewing, and revising of contracts, with senior lawyers reviewing their work, building up mental muscle memory.</li>

<li>But this kind of hands-on training of junior lawyers might become less common as clients increasingly use AI tools to draft <i>and review</i> contracts. (It's not unlike how the decline of jury trials in small cases led to fewer and fewer junior lawyers getting invaluable first-chair trial experience.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
So: How can junior lawyers grow into competent judges of AI work-product quality? This book aims to give contract newcomers a way to <i>begin</i> acquiring "artificial experience" (a term my late dad, a fighter pilot and then human-factors psychologist in the U.S. Air Force, would sometimes use).

This is an example of what software people call "D.R.Y. — "Don't Repeat Yourself." It can be a very <i>expensive</i> mistake if: &bull; a term is revised during negotiation, but &bull; the revision is not made in every place that the term occurs.
</p>

<p>
Some real-world examples are set out below.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Delaware case, a party <b>lost its rights under an intellectual-property license agreement</b> because it cured a breach, but did so too late:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The license agreement allowed the other party to terminate if a material breach was not cured within "<b>fifteen (30) days</b>" after notice of the breach. (Emphasis added.)</li>

<li>The breaching party initially refused to cure the breach, so the non-breaching party terminated the agreement shortly after <b>15 days</b> had elapsed from the notice of breach.</li>

<li>The breaching party had a change of heart after receiving the notice of termination and proceeded to cure the breach.</li>

<li>The court said, in effect, "sorry, too late" — because the word <i>fifteen</i> took precedence over the numerals <i>30</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Texas case, a D.R.Y. mistake once <b>cost a bank $693,000</b>: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The bank sued to recover $1.7 million from defaulting borrowers and their guarantor.</li>

<li>In the trial court, the bank won a summary judgment to collect from the guarantor.</li>

<li>Unfortunately for the bank, the appeals court reversed, because the loan documents referred to the amount borrowed as "one million <b>seven thousand</b> and no/100 ($1,700,000.00) dollars" (capitalization modified, emphasis added).</li>

<li>The appeals court held that, under standard interpretation principles, <i>the words</i>, not the numbers, controlled; thus, the amount guaranteed was only <b>$1.007 million</b>, not $1.7 million. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=659315655971355473">Charles R. Tips Family Trust v. PB Commercial LLC</a>, 459 S.W.3d 147 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2015) (reversing and remanding summary judgment in favor of bank). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
(You probably wouldn't want to be the junior associate or paralegal who oversaw the document preparation in that case.)
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: One of my clients was contemplated being acquired. A potential acquiring party proposed a confidentiality agreement (a.k.a. nondisclosure agreement a.k.a. NDA). 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The text said, in part: "&#x2026; said [confidentiality] obligations shall survive for a period of <b>five (3)</b> years from the later of the following: &#x2026;."</li>

<p>
Repetition can be used (cautiously) to emphasize a point. Part of the contract drafter's mission is to remind and persuade (see <a href="#educ-rdr">32.1</a>), not merely to slavishly follow drafting guidelines like this one.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-partn-r">
<p>
As a junior lawyer, there will be times when you will — and <i>should</i> — be uncertain about what to do in a contract draft, or how to phrase something. For example:
</p>

<p>
• When <i>drafting</i> a contract for a client, you might wonder whether to include a <a href="#r-forum-sel">forum-selection clause</a> (see Protocol <a href="#r-forum-sel">23.11</a>), because doing so might <a href="#poke-bear">poke the bear</a>, leading to problems in negotiation (the other side might repond by insisting that <i>their</i> home city be the exclusive forum instead).
</p>

<p>
• In <i>reviewing</i> another party's draft contract, you might see that the draft includes a forum-selection provision that requires all litigation to take place exclusively in the other side's home jurisdiction; you wonder whether the client will be OK with that.
</p>

<p>
To keep your client and your supervising partner happy (not to mention your malpractice carrier) here's what you do:
</p>

<p>
1.  <b>Check in with your supervising partner</b> — or, if you're the person who deals with the client, check in with <b>the client</b> — about the issue that concerns you, which here is the forum-selection provision. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Important: Have a well-thought-out recommendation for what to do</b> about the issue of concern, <b>with reasons</b> for your recommendation. This is true even if the recommendation is limited to advising the client to consider Factors X, Y, or Z in making a decision. That will give the partner or client a concrete proposal to consider, instead of just wondering about the issue in the abstract. (Also, superiors and clients tend to think, not unreasonably: <i>Bring me [proposed] solutions, not just problems</i>.)
</p>

<p>
BUT: <b>Don't just pick up the phone and call the partner or client every time an issue pops into your head</b>. No one likes to be repeatedly interrupted with questions. Instead:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make a list of things to discuss with the partner or client.</li>

<li>Schedule a meeting or phone call (or Zoom- or Teams call).</li>

<li>Use your list as an agenda — perhaps sending it to the client or partner in advance.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<i>Pro tip:</i> In Microsoft Word, you can add comment bubbles in the margin of a draft contract. Those comment bubbles can then be used as the discussion agenda during what's known as a "page-turn" conference call, where the participants go page by page through a draft contract or other document. (Ditto for discussing comments with the other side during a negotiation call.)
</p>

<p>
2.  <b>Then, <span class="underline">document</span> that you advised the client or partner</b> — in matter-of-fact, non-defensive language — either:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in an email to the partner or client, and/or</li>

<li>in Word comment bubbles in a draft that you sent to the partner or client, as discussed in the pro tip above.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's a real-life example: A startup-company client's CEO — let's call him "Bob" — once asked me to review a draft confidentiality agreement ("NDA") that had been sent to him by a potential customer, a giant, globally-known company that we'll call XYZ Corporation. At the time, I'd been working with Bob for many years at several different companies. Here's the email I sent Bob about XYZ's NDA form, only lightly edited — and the bold-faced type is pretty much what I did in the email to help Bob skim the text:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org8ff0168">
<p>
Hi Bob — BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) <i>[see <a href="#BLUF-rule">32.4</a>]</i>: <b>This NDA is probably OK for what you need here, but</b> there are a few things you might want to consider, and that we can discuss if you want.
</p>

<p>
1.  XYZ has included its <b>infamous "residuals clause"</b> <i>[see <a href="#nda-residuals-option">11.3.33.5</a>]</i> in this NDA, which is basically <b>a blank check</b> for XYZ to use whatever information you give them them — in section xx, it says:
</p>

<p>
"Neither of us can control &#x2026; what our representatives will remember, even without notes or other aids. We agree that use of information in representatives’ <i>unaided memories</i> in the development or deployment of our respective products or services <i>does not create liability</i> under this agreement or trade secret law, and we agree to <i>limit what we disclose</i> to the other accordingly." (Emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
BUSINESS QUESTION: Are you OK with giving XYZ that kind of permission for what you'll be disclosing to them?
</p>

<p>
2.  <b>Any litigation would have to be in</b> <i>[XYZ's headquarters city]</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Meh. <aside class="in"> I certainly wouldn't have been this informal with someone with whom I didn't have such a longstanding relationship. </aside>
</p>

<p>
3.  There's <b>no requirement that a recipient must return or destroy confidential information.</b>
</p>

<p>
I'm fine with that; I've come to think that omitting such a requirement is the most-sensible approach. <i>[See <a href="#r-info-purge">11.4</a>.]</i>
</p>

<p>
Otherwise XYZ's draft looks OK.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Notice what I did here: After a quick <a href="#BLUF-rule">BLUF</a> headline, I pointed out three issues — in <b>numbered paragraphs</b> — for which I wanted Bob's input, <span class="underline">and</span> <b>I made recommendations</b> as to the second two; Bob would ultimately make the decisions <b>what business risks to accept</b>.
</p>

<p>
This took a tiny bit more time for me to write. But it Served the Reader by making Bob's job easier. 
</p>

<p>
Epilogue: Bob emailed me back and asked for a phone conference with him and another executive from his company. That time, I <i>didn't</i> follow up with an email to confirm the plan of action we'd agreed on, but if I had done so, the confirming email might have been along the following lines:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org5ba05c6">
<p>
Bob, <b>confirming part of our phone conversation today</b>: XYZ NDA has an exclusive forum-selection provision that requires all litigation to be in [city]; under the circumstances I think that's probably <b>an acceptable business risk</b>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this any further</b>.
</p>

</div>

<p>
(Emphasis added.) Note how, in the first sentence, <b>I left a paper trail</b> for future litigation counsel, <b>recording</b> the facts: (i) that Bob and I had a phone conversation, and (ii) <b>when</b> that conversation occurred, which would help litigators construct a <b>timeline</b> of events — an important part of <i>any</i> lawsuit.
</p>

<p>
Note also my use of the term "<b>probably an acceptable business risk</b>," signaling that this was a <i>business</i> judgment for Bob to make.
</p>

<p>
IMPORTANT: Be careful about how you phrase your emails and other comments to the client or partner: <i>Assume</i> that <i>anything</i> you put in writing <i>might</i> someday be read by an adversary and possibly used against your client — or against you — in litigation. 
</p>

<p>
Sure, in some circumstances the attorney-client privilege <i>should</i> protect at least some of your written comments from discovery. But the privilege has its limits; moreover, the privilege can be waived — possibly inadvertently — or the privilege might even be pierced (e.g., by the crime-or-fraud exception).

<h3 id="partn-pref"><span class="section-number-3">32.11.</span> The "partner preference rule"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-partn-pref">
<p>
Students: When you're new to law practice and it comes to purely-stylistic preferences, <b>do it the way your supervising partner wants</b>.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you're a new lawyer in a law firm:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A partner in your firm assigns you to draft a contract.</li>

<li>In reviewing your draft, the partner tells you to write out, for example, <i>one million seven hundred thousand dollars ($1,700,000.00)</i>, instead of the simpler $1.7 million — even though this book <a href="#dont-repeat">strongly recommends against doing so</a> (messing this up once cost a Dallas-area lender $693,000, as explained at "Don't Repeat Yourself" at <a href="#dont-repeat">32.9</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can and should <b>alert the partner</b> to the potential problem with the partner's instruction. But if the partner still wants to do it that way, <b>don't fight the partner over this</b> — it's not a hill to die on, and you could annoy the partner and perhaps even harm your career prospects at the firm.  
</p>

<p>
There'll be plenty of time to use your own preferred style as you get more experienced and the partners increasingly trust you to handle things on your own — and especially if you start to bring in your own clients.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, of course, you'll have to be extra-careful not to make the kind of mistakes that can result from some of these suboptimal style practices, as discussed in this book.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-perfection" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="perfection"><span class="section-number-3">32.12.</span> Perfect is the enemy of good enough - but &#x2026;</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-perfection">
<p>
When it comes to contracts, clients tend overwhelmingly to believe that "perfect" is the enemy of "good enough." Most clients generally would <i>far</i> prefer to get an "OK" contract that covers the reasonably-likely contingencies, <i>and get it signed quickly</i>; they don't want to waste calendar time (nor to pay your legal fees), to get a gold-plated contract that covers unlikely and/or low-risk possibilities.
</p>

<p>
Of course, part of the problem is that hindsight is 20-20: If an "unlikely" possibility in fact comes to pass and causes problems for the client, guess where fingers might well be pointed for not having covered that possibility in the contract? No one said law practice was always easy &#x2026;.

As a before-and-after illustration, let's break up the following real-world  spaghetti clause, which is from the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/914025/000114036122011290/ny20003617x1_ex2-1.htm">merger agreement</a> where Hewlett-Packard (HP, Inc.) acquired well-known headset manufacturer Plantronics.

<p>
BEFORE:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
SECTION 1.01   <b>The Merger.</b>  On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”) and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL. At the election of Parent, any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for Merger Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger, in which event the parties shall execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect the foregoing; provided that in no event shall the Company be required to amend this Agreement in any manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay the Closing or otherwise reduce the Merger Consideration or impair the other benefits expected to accrue to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the “Transactions.”

<p>
AFTER, with Q&A subheadings: <aside> The subheading "numbering" here is arbitrary; I've also made other stylistic edits, and as it happens, there are both questions and a few answers. </aside>
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org507cadc">
<p>
SECTION 1.01   <b>The Merger.</b> 
</p>

<p>
1.01(a)  <b>When will the Merger take effect?</b>
</p>

<p>
The Merger will take effect at the Effective Time <i>[defined elsewhere]</i>.
</p>

<p>
1.01(b)  <b>What will happen to Merger Sub when the Merger takes effect?</b>
</p>

<p>
When the Merger takes effect:
</p>

<p>
(1)  Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Target;
</p>

<p>
(2)  The Target <del>shall</del> <span class="underline">will</span> continue as the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”); and
</p>

<p>
(3)  Merger Sub's separate corporate existence <del>shall</del> <span class="underline">will</span> cease.
</p>

<p>
1.01(c)  <b>What will happen to Merger Sub's <i>assets</i>, etc.?</b>
</p>

<p>
When the Merger becomes effective, the Target will succeed to all the rights, and assume all the obligations, of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL <i>[Delaware General Corporation Law]</i>. 
</p>

<p>
1.01(d)  <b>Could the Buyer switch Merger Sub with another subsidiary</b>?
</p>

<p>
The Buyer may elect to replace the Merger Sub, as a party to the Merger, with any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer; if that occurs, then that other subsidiary will be merged into the Target instead of Merger Sub.
</p>

<p>
1.01(e)  <b>An appropriate amendment will be needed if a replacement does occur</b>
</p>

<p>
If Merger Sub is replaced with another Buyer subsidiary as provided in subdivision (d), THEN: The parties will negotiate and sign an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect the replacement.
</p>

<p>
1.01(f)  <b>Are there limits on what the Target <br>
must agree to in the replacement amendment?</b>
</p>

<p>
The Target need not agree, in the replacement amendment to this Agreement, to any change that would reasonably be expected: 
</p>

<p>
(1) to prevent, impair or delay the Closing or otherwise reduce the Merger Consideration, nor 
</p>

<p>
(2) impair the other benefits expected to accrue to the holders of Target Common Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-faq-what-if">
<p>
There's another potential advantage of Q&A subheading format: When you phrase a subheading as a question, it prompts the reader to think of other possible answers — more so than simply presenting an answer. That's likely to be useful in doing the "business planning" for a contract.
</p>

<p>
It also seems likely that posing a question helps the reader more-quickly grasp the topic of the relevant clause or section, reducing the reader's cognitive burden. <cite> See Izaias Cavalcanti, <a href="https://www.worldcc.com/Resources/Blogs-and-Journals/Contracting-Excellence-Journal/View/ArticleId/11620/The-psychology-that-makes-people-skip-reading-contracts-and-how-to-change-it?">The psychology that makes people skip reading contracts – and how to change it</a> (WorldCC.com 2025). </cite>

<p>
Tangentially: Amazon reportedly does product- and service development with a "work backwards from the customer experience" approach, doing the business planning by writing and refining mock press releases and frequently-asked questions documents; Amazon refers to this as the company's "PR/FAQ" approach. <cite> See Colin Bryar and Bill Carr, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets-ebook/dp/B08BYCQBZN">Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon</a> ch. 5 (2021), by two longtime Amazon senior executives, now co-founders of <a href="https://workingbackwards.com/about/">Working Backwards LLC</a>), <i>excerpted at</i> <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes">An insider look at Amazon's culture and processes</a> (AboutAmazon.com); Werner Vogels, <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2024/11/aws-lambda-turns-10-a-rare-look-at-the-doc-that-started-it.html">AWS Lambda turns 10: A rare look at the doc that started it</a> (AllThingsDistributed.com 2024) (case study by Amazon's chief technology officer). </cite>

<h4 id="ack-why"><span class="section-number-4">33.1.1.</span> Why include acknowledgements in a contract?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-ack-why">
<p>
Having a party "acknowledge" one or more things in a contract can save time and money by pre-establishing agreed facts for future litigation. This can help parties save the time and cost that might otherwise be needed to "prove up" those facts, because in the U.S., an "acknowledgement" in the body of a contract is much like an admission in litigation. <b>But:</b> A party might be stuck with its acknowledgements — to its detriment &#x2026;.

<h4 id="r-ack-defn-pat"><span class="section-number-4">33.1.2.</span> You could be stuck with an acknowledgement</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-r-ack-defn-pat">
<p>
If your client acknowledges something in a contract, it could lock the client into a position that the client might later want to modify or even disavow based on updated information. That's because an acknowledgement in a contract is much like an admission in a lawsuit — and in U.S. federal cases, the trial judge has discretion to allow a party to back away from a previous admission, under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_36#rule_36_b">Rule 36(b)</a> of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A German company, Peiker Acustic, developed and sold technology for hands-free cell phone use. Peiker signed a contract with Cellport Systems to be licensed under certain Cellport patents. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the license agreement, Peiker "acknowledged" that two particular Peiker products came within the scope of the patent claims. (That's the point of saying that an acknowledgement could be of a statement of <i>law</i>.)</li>

<li>Later, though, Peiker changed its mind and tried to back away from that acknowledgement, claiming that those products weren't covered by the patent after all, and thus that Peiker shouldn't have to pay royalties for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Peiker won in the trial court, which said that the acknowledgement in the license agreement was merely a "rebuttable presumption." 
</p>

<p>
On appeal, though, the Tenth Circuit reversed and remanded as to that part of the case, holding that Peiker did indeed have to pay royalties on those products. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3387154681227577319">Cellport Sys., Inc. v. Peiker Acustic GmbH & Co., KG</a>, 762 F.3d 1016, 1022-23 (10th Cir. 2014) (reversing and remanding trial-court judgment in part). </cite>

<h4 id="AckAgrK"><span class="section-number-4">33.1.3.</span> Caution: An "acknowledgement" <i>might</i> create binding <i>obligations</i></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-AckAgrK">
<p>
"Acknowledging" terms and conditions in a contract might be interpreted as <i>assenting to</i> and agreeing to be bound by those terms and conditions. This would likely be the case, though only if the acknowledgement was reasonably clear about the binding effect. <b>Pro tip:</b> Drafters, in this situation (as in so many others), it's often better to err on the side of in-your-face explicitness.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: An employee was held to have agreed that his employer would own certain intellectual property that the employee created, because the employee had clicked on an "acknowledge" button for the employer's invention-assignment agreement. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13441699439384457717">Apprio, Inc. v. Zaccari</a>, 104 F.4th 897, 907 (D.C. Cir. 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> A state supreme court held that <i>what an employee had acknowledged</i> (i.e., a directive to read a new policy) hadn't modified the employee's pre-existing employment contract — consequently, arbitration wasn't required. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10536068526708323376">Lampo v. Amedisys Holding, LLC</a>, 445 S.C. 305, 914 S.E.2d 139 (2025) (reversing and remanding court of appeals decision). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A client of a Royal Bank of Canada investment-banking unit signed the bank's standard customer agreement.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The customer agreement included a first-person statement in which the client said, "I agree that all transactions with respect to any such Account shall be subject to the following terms."</li>

<li>Among those "following terms" was that the customer's transactions with the bank would be "subject to" external rules, including FINRA rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Citing numerous cases, the Eighth Circuit held that such "I agree" and "subject to" language was an <i>acknowledgement</i> that put the client on notice of how transactions would be handled — even though that language <i>didn't</i> constitute a contractual <i>commitment</i> by the bank to handle transactions in that way. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10516055426409894029">Luis v. RBC Capital Markets, LLC</a>, 984 F.3d 575, 580 (8th Cir. 2020) (citing numerous cases), <i>affirming</i> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18109488917499003841">401 F. Supp. 3d 817</a> (D. Minn. 2019) (summary judgment dismissing clients' breach-of-contract claims against bank). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco">Cisco</a>, a global networking-technology conglomerate, once used a set of "standard terms and conditions of purchase" to accompany purchase orders submitted to suppliers. In those Cisco T&Cs, section 1 states as follows: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Supplier's electronic acceptance, <b>acknowledgement</b> of this Purchase Order, or commencement of performance <b>constitutes Supplier's acceptance of these terms and conditions</b>. <i>(Bold-faced emphasis added.)</i> <cite> Archived at <a href="https://perma.cc/SD47-YCHU">https://perma.cc/SD47-YCHU</a>, discussed briefly at <a href="#fill-po">15.9.12.4</a>. </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
So: Suppose that a supplier receives one of those Cisco POs, and a supplier representative responds by email, "got it, thanks." According to Cisco's T&Cs, the supplier might have legally agreed to all of Cisco's terms.

<h4 id="AckRel"><span class="section-number-4">33.1.4.</span> An acknowledgement invites reliance.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-AckRel">
<p>
As discussed at <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">18.2</a> (and illustrated in the "Hill of Proof" diagram at <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>): Suppose that <i>B</i> wants to claim that, by signing a contract with a particular statement in it — let's call it the "Statement" — <i>A</i> had made a false representation. Technically, for <i>B</i> to meet its burden of proof, it must show:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>that <i>B</i> had in fact <i>relied</i> on the Statement;</li>

<li>that <i>A</i> had <i>intended</i> for <i>B</i> to rely on the Statement;</li>

<li>that under the circumstances, <i>B</i> reliance on the Statement was <i>reasonable</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
As a practical matter, if the contract  stated that <i>A</i> acknowledged the <i>Statement</i> — e.g., the statement about patent coverage in the <i>Cellport</i> contract above — then <i>B</i> would likely have a much-easier time making all of these  showings.

In some circumstances, a party that didn't sign the Con&shy;tract might be bound by it, for example as a so-called third-party beneficiary (concerning which, see Protocol <a href="#r-third-ben">2.11</a>).

<h4 id="ack-jerk"><span class="section-number-4">33.1.6.</span> Pro tip: Don't be a [jerk] in drafting acknowledgements.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-ack-jerk">
<p>
Some inexperienced drafters include statements in which another party "acknowledges" a supposed fact that would be against that party's interest, big time. Here's an overreaching example of a kind that's sometimes seen in confidentiality agreements ("NDAs"), along with a possible edit: 
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="orgb224879">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>   Recipient acknowledges that Discloser <b>would be</b> irreparably harmed by a breach or threatened breach of Recipient's confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>   Recipient acknowledges that Discloser <b>could be</b> irreparably harmed by a breach or threatened breach of Recipient's confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.
</p>

</div>
<p>
(Emphasis added.)
</p>

<p>
Note the change from "would" to "could be irreparably harmed." If you're the Discloser-drafter here, your hope is (presumably) that the Recipient would overlook the "would be irreparably harmed" language. That'd amount to the Recipient's unthinkingly waiving the Discloser's burden of proof in seeking a preliminary injunction or comparable relief (see <a href="#r-eq-rlf-cls">23.10</a>).
</p>

<p>
<b>That, though, would likely slow up getting to signature</b>: Diligent Recipient counsel, confronted with this kind of language, would probably do one or more of the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>be at least mildly irritated at Discloser's counsel for the obnoxious drafting; and</li>
<li>change "<i>would</i> be &#x2026;" to "<i>could</i> be irreparably harmed" as shown above; or</li>
<li>delete the equitable-relief acknowledgement entirely — this would be an example of Discloser's drafter having (unwisely) "poked the bear," see <a href="#poke-bear">30.14</a>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-antitr-hor-vert">
<p>
Restraints subject to Section 1  are generally categorized as <i>horizontal</i> or <i>vertical</i>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A horizontal restraint is <i>an agreement among competitors</i> on the way in which they will compete with one another.</li>

<li>Vertical restraints are restraints <i>imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution</i>.</li>

<h4 id="nl-antitr-vert-horiz-ct"><span class="section-number-4">33.2.5.</span> How do courts assess the reasonableness of restraints?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-antitr-vert-horiz-ct">
<p>
Courts employ two different standards to determine whether a particular restraint is unreasonable: 
</p>

<p>
1.  The first standard involves a factual inquiry commonly known as the "rule of reason." The rule of reason weighs legitimate justifications for a restraint against any anticompetitive effects. 
</p>

<p>
Nearly every <i>vertical</i> restraint is assessed under the rule of reason.
</p>

<p>
We conduct a fact-specific assessment to distinguish between:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and</li>

<li>restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer's best interest.</li>
</ul>

<p>
2.  The second standard is the <i>per se</i> standard, which recognizes that a small group of restraints are unreasonable per se because they always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output. Such agreements or practices are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Typically only horizontal restraints qualify as unreasonable <i>per se</i>.</b>
</p>

<p>
However, <b>not all horizontal restraints are analyzed pursuant to the <i>per se</i> standard</b>. 
</p>

<p>
<i>DCT note: In late 2024, a federal district court held that "algorithmic pricing" of apartment rents, facilitated by a provider of revenue-management software, was part of a horizontal conspiracy that was subject to the per-se rule: "The combination and conspiracy allegedly involved (a) a set of vertical agreements between Yardi Systems, Inc., and each individual [apartment-owner] lessor defendant for the use of Yardi's revenue management software, (b) a continuing horizontal agreement between and among the lessor defendants to provide their commercially sensitive information to Yardi, to use Yardi's revenue management software, and to implement the recommendations generated, and (c) a shared understanding that Yardi would use the information provided to recommended rental rates above what would be earned in a competitive market."</i> <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13815703686456729339">Duffy v. Yardi Systems, Inc.</a>, 758 F. Supp. 3d 1283, 1289 (W.D. Wash. 2024) (denying defendants' joint motion to dismiss). </cite>
</p>

<p>
<i>Relatedly: In August 2024, the Department of Justice and the attorneys general of eight states <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-realpage-algorithmic-pricing-scheme-harms-millions-american-renters">filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against RealPage Inc.</a> alleging similar conduct.</i>
</p>

<p>
The notion of a "rule of reason" is the opposite of a "per-se rule" or "bright-line rule," and means that the outcome might be affected by differences in facts (or in online parlance: YMMV, Your Mileage May Vary). See generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_reason">Rule of reason</a> (Wikipedia.org).
</p>

<p>
In a 2024 paper, professors Mark Lemley, of Stanford Law,) and Michael Carrier, of Rutgers Law, argue in effect that the rule of reason might be just window dressing (my words):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Given that the rule of reason is often said to be at the center of antitrust law, and that balancing is at the heart of the rule of reason, it is quite surprising to discover that courts almost never do any actual balancing of harms and benefits. Indeed, balancing has become so rare that in the Supreme Court’s two most recent articulations of the rule of reason test, it omitted the actual balancing of anticompetitive harms and procompetitive benefits altogether! <cite> Mark A. Lemley and Michael A. Carrier, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4896529">Rule or Reason?

<h4 id="nl-antitr-hor-ancil"><span class="section-number-4">33.2.6.</span> What sorts of "horizontal" restraints might be OK?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-antitr-hor-ancil">
<p>
Under the "ancillary restraints" doctrine, a horizontal agreement is exempt from the <i>per se</i> rule, and analyzed under the rule-of-reason, if it meets two requirements. 
</p>

<p>
These requirements are that the restraint must be (1) subordinate and collateral to a separate, legitimate transaction, and (2) reasonably necessary to achieving that transaction's pro-competitive purpose. 
</p>

<p>
"Naked restraints" are categorically <i>not</i> "ancillary restraints." Thus, <b>naked horizontal restraints are always analyzed under the <i>per se</i> standard</b>. 
</p>

<p>
A restraint is naked if it has no purpose except stifling of competition. 
</p>

<p>
Some examples of these restraints include <b>agreements among actual or potential competitors to fix prices or divide markets</b>.

<h4 id="nl-Collusion"><span class="section-number-4">33.2.7.</span> One type of "section 1 violation":  Unlawful (horizontal) price-fixing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-Collusion">
<p>
Sometimes it might seem tempting to agree with a competitor to divvy up customers, or to keep your prices at an agreed level, or to take turns submitting the winning bid in response to customers' requests for proposal ("RFPs"). 
</p>

<p>
Those activities, though, can lead to indictment and prosecution by federal- or state authorities for violation of the antitrust laws.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The German airline Lufthansa and the British airline Virgin Atlantic blew the whistle on a price-fixing scheme by a total of 21 non-U.S. airlines, including British Airways, Qantas, and Korean Air. The U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted, resulting in
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a total of some $1.7 billion in fines; and</li>
<li>four airline executives being <b>sentenced to prison terms</b> in the U.S. (<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41926712/ns/travel-news/">link</a>) (<a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2007/August/07_at_569.html">link</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Authorities might go for low-hanging fruit: Instead of trying to prove up an antitrust violation (a complex task), they might bring charges of <b>obstruction</b> of justice, akin to prosecuting Al Capone for tax evasion. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A British executive, after being extradited to the U.S., was sentenced to 18 months in prison and a $25,000 fine for <i>conspiring to obstruct</i> a price-fixing investigation (<a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/December/10-at-1426.html">link</a>).

</p>

<p>
Not every agreement to restrain trade violates the antitrust laws. Because some cases are more obvious than others, the law has evolved to use <b>different tests</b> depending on the closeness of the question. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At one end of the spectrum are arrangements that can be condemned as illegal <i>per se</i>, or—as in the case of horizontal agreements—at least so likely to be unlawful that just a "<b>quick look</b>" is enough to recognize that <b>anticompetitive effects may be presumed</b>.</li>

<li>At the other end of the spectrum are arrangements that are <b>plainly lawful</b>.</li>

<li>And <b>in between lie the vast majority, where careful scrutiny is necessary</b> to decide.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this category—which includes <b>purely vertical agreements</b>, as well as <b>hybrid agreements</b> — the "quick-look" approach is inapt, and <b>the plaintiff has the initial burden of showing anticompetitive effect under the "rule of reason."</b>
</p>

<p>
The central—and dispositive—question in this case is which framework applies. 
</p>

<p>
Appellant Winn-Dixie Stores brought suit against Appellees—the Eastern Mushroom Marketing Cooperative, Inc. (EMMC), its individual mushroom farmer members, and certain downstream distributors—claiming their price-fixing agreement violated § 1 of the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1. 
</p>

<p>
The District Court instructed the jury to apply the "rule-of-reason" test, and <b>the jury returned a verdict in Appellees' favor</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Winn-Dixie contends this was error, and had the judge applied the "quick-look" approach and instructed the jury to simply presume anticompetitive effects, it would have found Appellees' agreement to be an unlawful restraint of trade. As plaintiff, Winn-Dixie understandably would have preferred the lower burden of proof. 
</p>

<p>
But because <b>this hybrid scheme involved myriad organizational structures with varying degrees of vertical integration</b>, the Court was right to apply the rule of reason. 
</p>

<p>
And because, under that more searching inquiry, <b>the evidence at trial was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict</b>, we will affirm the judgment in favor of Appellees.

<h4 id="nl-auto-stay"><span class="section-number-4">33.3.1.</span> The automatic stay against termination (etc.)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-auto-stay">
<p>
Consider the situation where <i>A</i> wants to terminate its contract with <i>B</i>. Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/365">section 365(e)(1)</a> of the (U.S.) Bankruptcy Code of 1978, if <i>B</i> files a petition for protection under the bankruptcy laws — or if <i>B</i>'s <i>creditors</i> file an "involuntary" petition against <i>B</i> — then that filing creates an "automatic stay," prohibiting A from taking any of several forms of contract termination (as well as various other actions).
</p>

<p>
The rationale here is that termination of a contract could jeopardize the orderly reorganization or liquidation of B's business. In the bankruptcy proceeding, <i>B</i> is referred to as the "debtor," and B's business and assets are referred to as "the estate" of the debtor.
</p>

<p>
(The basics of this subject are usefully explained in Robert L. Eisenbach III, <a href="http://bankruptcy.cooley.com/2007/09/articles/business-bankruptcy-issues/are-termination-on-bankruptcy-contract-clauses-enforceable/">Are "Termination On Bankruptcy" Contract Clauses Enforceable?</a> (Cooley.com 2007), <a href="https://perma.cc/PV6N-VFTC">https://perma.cc/PV6N-VFTC</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Even though such termination-<i>for</i>-bankruptcy provisions are unenforceable in the U.S., lawyers keep including them in contracts anyway. The usual rationale is that U.S. bankruptcy law might not apply (e.g., in a non-U.S. transaction), and who knows, Congress might repeal that part of the Code (unlikely).
</p>

<p>
As an "in the wild" example of such a provision, see a Honeywell purchase-order form at <a href="http://perma.cc/CUV6-NKTY">http://perma.cc/CUV6-NKTY</a>, which states as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The solvent party <i>[sic]</i> may terminate this Purchase Order upon written notice if the other party becomes insolvent or if any petition is filed or proceedings commenced by or against that party relating to bankruptcy, receivership, reorganization, or assignment for the benefit of creditors.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> Don't say that "the <i>solvent</i> party may terminate," as in the Honeywell example just above, because if the terminating party is <i>also</i> insolvent, then a court might hold that the party wasn't entitled to terminate — and so the termination was itself an "own goal" breach of the contract — as discussed in more detail in the commentary at § <a href="#termin-rt">20.6.1.1</a>.

<h4 id="nl-GuarPrefPmtRef"><span class="section-number-4">33.3.3.</span> Preference-payments refunds in bankruptcy</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-GuarPrefPmtRef">
<p>
Here's a not-uncommon situation, especially during economic downturns:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A customer places an order with a supplier.</li>
<li>In due course, the customer pays the supplier's invoice in due course.</li>
<li><b>But:</b> Within the next 90 days, the customer files for protection under the bankruptcy laws.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that situation, the supplier might be compelled by law to refund Customer's invoice payment; this is referred to as an "avoidable preference." <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3438768229025420150">Coles v. Glaser</a>, 2 Cal. App. 5th 384, 389, 205 Cal. Rptr.3d 922 (2016) (with extensive citations). See also, e.g.: Patricia Dzikowski, <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/bankruptcy-trustee-preference-claims-prior-transfers.html">The Bankruptcy Trustee and Preference Claims</a> (Nolo.com; undated); Kathleen Michon, <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/pre-bankruptcy-payments-creditors-can-the-trustee-get-the-money-back.html">Pre-Bankruptcy Payments to Creditors: Can the Trustee Get the Money Back?</a> (Nolo.com; undated); the guaranty language in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11081049436389993245">Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank, B.A. v. Navarro</a>, 25 N.Y.3d 485, 488, 36 N.E.3d 80, 15 N.Y.S.3d 277 (2015). </cite>
</p>

<p>
To be sure: The supplier would have the right to contest its obligation to refund the customer's payment, for example by showing that the payment was made in the ordinary course of business. But contesting a preference action can be difficult and costly; that's because, under bankruptcy law, the supplier would have to successfully jump through some evidentiary hoops to <i>show</i> that it was entitled to keep the customer's payment.
</p>

<p>
And in any event, as a practical matter many avoidable-preference cases are settled; in the above situation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The customer's "estate" (a bankruptcy term) would likely settle for less than a complete refund of what the customer had paid the supplier.</li>

<li>In return, the supplier would give the customer a <i>partial</i> refund so as to avoid the expense and hassle of jumping through the required proof hoops in bankruptcy court.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That's where the supplier would want to be able to invoke a third party's guaranty of payment: In many guaranties, the guarantor would be on the hook to reimburse the supplier for the supplier's refund to the customer — and probably for the supplier's associated legal expenses as well, if the guaranty said so. (For an example of bankruptcy-reimbursement language along similar lines, see paragraph 7 of a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066134/000119312510000891/dex103.htm">Bank of America guaranty form</a>.)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-buy-sell">
<p>
A "buy-sell" procedure is related to the ancient "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_choose">divide and choose</a>" procedure, sometimes known as "I cut, <i>you</i> choose," by which children can evenly divide a cookie between them.
</p>

<p>
Something like this procedure is seen in the Book of Genesis, when Abram (later Abraham) and his kinsman Lot agree to separate, and by agreement, Abram allows <i>Lot</i> to choose which part of the Promised Land to claim and settle in. <cite> See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2013&version=NIV">Gen. 13:8-10</a>; see also, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_and_Lot%27s_conflict">Abraham and Lot's conflict</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Buy-sell agreements are often used for breakups of small companies. Suppose that a company  has two owners, "Fred" and "Ginger," who find that they can no longer get along. A buy-sell agreement requires (let's say) <i>Fred</i> to <i>offer</i> to buy out Ginger's share of the company so that she'll be the one to exit the business and leave Fred as the sole owner — but then <i>Ginger</i> gets to decide whether —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to accept Fred's buy-out offer and leave the business; or</li>

<li>instead, to require <i>Fred</i> to sell out to her — on the terms that Fred had proposed to her.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This gives Fred a powerful incentive to offer fair terms to Ginger — because if Fred's terms <i>aren't</i> fair, then Ginger can turn the tables on him and kick <i>him</i> out of the business instead of exiting the business herself.
</p>

<p>
A buy-sell agreement is somewhat akin to baseball arbitration, which likewise encourages parties to make fair offers to settle disputes, as discussed at <a href="#r-escal-ext">2.6</a>.

1.  "Click-wrap agreements": When a user installs software on a computer, or signs up for an online service, very often the user must click on a button or link that says (in effect) "I agree"; the click purportedly signifies that the user — and the user's company — are agreeing to detailed terms and conditions.
</p>

<p>
2.  "Browse-wrap agreements": An online service might also include a purported agreement that the user supposedly agrees to: (i) by continuing to take an action, e.g., continuing to browse a Web site, or (ii) by <i>not</i> taking other action, e.g., by <i>not</i> leaving a Web site.

The enforceability of click-wrap and browse-wrap agreements has been often litigated; see generally the posts of law professor Eric Goldman — who knows pretty much what there is to be known on this subject — and his colleagues at his <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2023/08/more-chaos-in-the-law-of-online-contract-formation.htm">Technology & Marketing Law Blog</a>.

<p>
Often, Wrap Terms will be unobjectionable, addressing matters such as not making unreasonable use of an online service, not trying to steal other users' data, and the like. 
</p>

<p>
But sometimes, Wrap Terms will be like a supplier's order confirmation, setting out the supplier's wish list for ground rules — and sometimes a supplier's click-wrap or browse-wrap agreement will contain terms and conditions that affect the parties' negotiated deal.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-wu-uber">
<p>
In its <i>Wu v. Uber</i> opinion, New York's highest court blessed the process that Uber used to amend its online terms of service to incorporate an arbitration provision:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
We now turn to the application of these principles to Uber's January 2021 terms of use. Only a few days before plaintiff purportedly agreed to the terms, she received the following email:
</p>

<p>
The headline of the email, "Updated Terms of Use," and the large text immediately beneath it <b>clearly informed plaintiff</b> that she would soon "be asked to review and agree to [Uber's] updated terms [of use]." 
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the email <b>specifically advised</b> plaintiff that the terms would include, among other subjects, "changes to the Arbitration Agreement." 
</p>

<p>
The terms were <b>accessible through several hyperlinks</b>, including a large black button at the very top of the email specifically labeled "Review terms," and the text "Terms of Use" in the first line of the first paragraph, which was <b>distinguished from the black text surrounding it</b> by the signature blue font indicating a hyperlink.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the text of the email <b>expressly advised</b> plaintiff how she could manifest assent to the terms, i.e., by tapping "Confirm" on a pop-up window that would automatically appear when she opened the Uber application on her smartphone. The email was written in plain language.
</p>

<p>
Only a few days later, Uber's January 2021 terms of use were <b>presented</b> to plaintiff by means of a <b>clickwrap process*—a means of acquiring binding assent from consumers that has been *widely upheld</b> by courts across the country. 
</p>

<p>
As previewed in the email, plaintiff was presented with the following pop-up screen when she opened the Uber app on her smartphone:
</p>

<p>
The headline and the larger text in the center of the screen—"We've updated our terms" and "We encourage you to read our updated Terms in full"—*clearly advised* plaintiff that she was being asked to agree to a contract with Uber.
</p>

<p>
The terms themselves were <b>again made accessible</b> by a hyperlink on the words "Terms of Use," which were formatted in <b>large, underlined, blue text</b>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>A reasonably prudent user would have understood</b> from the color, underlining, and placement of that text, immediately beneath the sentence "encourag[ing]" users to "read [the] updated Terms in full," that clicking on the words "Terms of Use" would permit them to review those terms in their entirety. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, Uber provided plaintiff with an <b>unambiguous means of accepting the terms</b> by including a checkbox, "Confirm" button, and bolded text expressly stating that, "By checking the box, I have reviewed and agree to the Terms of Use." It is undisputed that plaintiff checked and box and clicked the "confirm" button. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4811284305254505900">Wu v.

<p>
Contracts often use the terms <i>discretion</i>, <i>sole discretion</i>, <i>unfettered discretion</i>, and <i>reasonable discretion</i>; this Protocol seeks to provide clear meanings for the underlying word <i>discretion</i> — while recognizing that courts might impose their own meanings, as discussed below.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-discr-sole-lim" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="discr-sole-lim"><span class="section-number-4">33.8.2.</span> "Sole and unfettered discretion" might not mean <i>quite</i> that</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-discr-sole-lim">
<p>
A.&nbsp; A New York appeals court took a jaundiced view of a party's position about a "sole and absolute discretion" clause in an agreement, noting that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
[E]ven where one has an apparently unlimited right under a contract, that right may not be exercised solely for personal gain in such a way as to deprive the other party of the fruits of the contract. Thus, even an explicitly discretionary contract right may not be exercised in bad faith so as to frustrate the other party's right to the benefit under the agreement. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8901689424505951736">Shatz v. Chertok</a>, 180 A.D.3d 609, 610, 117 N.Y.S.3d 239, 2020 NY Slip Op 1383 (N.Y. App. Div.) (affirming denial of motion to dismiss complaint for breach of fiduciary duty; cleaned up, citation omitted, extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
B.&nbsp; In the UK, there is case law indicating that discretion must be exercised in good faith and not arbitrarily, capriciously, or irrationally. <cite> See generally James Brown, <a href="https://www.haynesboone.com/alerts/cathay-pacific-airways-limited-v-lufthansa-technik-ag">Cathay Pacific Airways Limited v. Lufthansa Technik AG - the extent to which contractual rights be limited by considerations of good faith or a duty to act “rationally”?</a> (HaynesBoone.com 2020) <i>discussing</i> <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2020/1789.html">Cathay Pacific Airways Limited v.

</p>

<p>
C.&nbsp; Analogously: In the context of <i>judicial</i> discretion, in a case <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13800665423501484885">Halo Electronics</a> (U.S. 2016), concerning certain statutory trial-court discretion in patent cases, the Supreme Court noted that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Discretion is not whim. In a system of laws discretion is rarely without limits, even when the statute does not specify any limits upon the district courts' discretion. 
</p>

<p>
A motion to a court's discretion is a motion, not to its inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles. Thus, &#x2026; a district court's discretion should be exercised in light of the considerations underlying the grant of that discretion. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13800665423501484885">Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc.</a>, 136 S. Ct. 1923, 1931-32 (2016) (cleaned up, citations omitted, extra paragraphing added). This concerned a trial court's statutory discretion, in "exceptional" cases, to increase the damages for patent infringement. </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-33-8-3">
<p>
It can be helpful for a contract to explain the factors that can be permissibly taken into account in exercising discretion. EXAMPLE: In a Second Circuit case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An energy supply company was sued for breach of contract for allegedly failing to charge competitive rates for electricity.</li>

<li>The company's agreement form provided for a variable monthly rate that the company would set at its discretion; the agreement "listed several factors guiding that discretion, including 'market-related factors' and [the company's] 'costs, expenses and margins.'"</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the company because the plaintiff "received what was promised under the plain terms of the agreement &#x2026;."

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-33-8-4">
<p>
In a Texas case, a sale-and-purchase letter agreement gave a buyer the "sole discretion" to close a purchase transction (after doing due diligence about the purchase). A state court held that this unfettered walk-away right made the agreement contract illusory and unenforceable, as long as there was no separate consideration for the walk-away right. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7837640098008907112">Maverick Nat.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-cre-why">
<p>
Contract drafters often say that a party will make <i>[something] efforts</i>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>when they don't want to take the time to negotiate a specific standard of performance — especially if their clients simply don't know what the standard <i>should</i> be in as-yet undetermined future circumstances, and they don't want to spend the time to try to figure it out;</li>

<li>in the case of <i>commercially reasonable</i> efforts: to emphasize that the term requires what <i>business people</i> would regard as reasonable efforts <b>and</b> - as an alternative to the stronger commitment of <i>best efforts</i> (see Protocol <a href="#r-best-efforts-defn">13.1</a>).</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-nl-CREUnclear" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="nl-CREUnclear"><span class="section-number-4">33.9.2.</span> Problem: The lack of clarity in the case law</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-CREUnclear">
<p>
In Delaware's 2024 <i>Fortis Advisors</i> case, Vice Chancellor Will noted that "there is no agreement in case law over whether <i>[efforts clauses]</i> create different standards. Delaware courts have viewed variations of efforts clauses—particularly those using the term 'reasonable'—as largely interchangeable." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3585890316977952996">Fortis Advisors LLC v. Johnson & Johnson</a>, No. 2020-0881-LWW, slip op. at text acc'g n.350 (Del. Ch. Sept. 4, 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Likewise, in the 2010 <i>Citri-Lite</i> case, a federal court in California noted that that "[t]here is no settled or universally accepted definition of the term commercially reasonable efforts." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15202977054272395445">Citri-Lite Co. v. Cott Beverages, Inc.</a>, 721 F. Supp. 2d 912, 926 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (denying defendant's motion for summary judgment; cleaned up). After trial, the court elaborated on this observation, with citations; see <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-caed-1_07-cv-01075/pdf/USCOURTS-caed-1_07-cv-01075-15.pdf#page=1.00&gsr=0">findings of fact and conclusions of law after bench trial</a>, slip op. at 45, <i>aff'd</i>, <a href="https://perma.cc/D8DC-J3GN">No. 11-17609</a> (9th Cir. Nov. 21, 2013) (unpublished). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the Southern District of New York — after extensively reviewing case law — remarked that "New York case law interpreting other efforts clauses, including best efforts and reasonable efforts clauses, is anything but a model of clarity." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=598465974293934143">Holland Loader Company, LLC v. FLSMidth A/S</a>, 313 F. Supp. 3d 447, 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (after bench trial, holding that defendant had failed to use commercially-reasonable efforts). </cite>

<p>
It will often be "a factually intense issue" whether a party has <i>complied</i> with an obligation to exert particular efforts — and thus it frequently happens that a court will deny <i>summary</i> judgment, necessitating a costly trial, as happened in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15202977054272395445">Citri-Lite</a>, cited above, and in other cases. <cite> See also, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1331132673644442581">MY Imagination, LLC v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-RussellZimmer">
<p>
EXAMPLE: In a 2023 Seventh Circuit decision, the contract in suit provided an example of an extremely-detailed definition of "commercially reasonable efforts"; that definition focused "inward" on the buyer's own practices, as opposed to an "outward" focus on industry standards for what would be done by similarly-situated business. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15881487331300468195">Russell v. Zimmer, Inc.</a>, 82 F.4th 564, 566-70 (7th Cir. 2023) (affirming dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted). </cite>

<h4 id="nl-cre-comp"><span class="section-number-4">33.9.5.</span> Use "comparables"? (Maybe not.)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-cre-comp">
<p>
Industry standards or other "comparables" might not be helpful: In a 2024 Delaware case, the contract in suit defined "commercially reasonable efforts" as "the exercise of such efforts and commitment of such resources by a company with substantially the same resources and expertise as [the defendant], with due regard to the nature of efforts and cost required for the undertaking at stake." Vice Chancellor Glasscock characterized this definition as "unusual" and remarked that "[a]fter trial, I find this method unworkable; no exemplar companies operate under the actual conditions of Defendants, who, I note, are also different from one another as to their circumstances." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15621251956044928976">Himawan v. Cephalon, Inc.</a>, No. 018-0075, text acc. nn.44, 165 (Del. Ch. Apr. 30, 2024) (holding that defendants had not breached their obligation to comply with contract's commercially-reasonable efforts provision). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The court went on:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
"Due regard" for the "efforts and costs" means that Defendants may eschew development where the circumstances reasonably indicate, as a business decision, that they not go forward. This includes all the costs and risks involved, including the milestone payments and the opportunity costs faced by Defendants, as evidenced by the provision that the reasonableness be measured against the actions expected of a company with "substantially the same resources and expertise" as the buyer. That is, if a reasonable actor with faced with the same restraints and risks would go forward <i>in its own self-interest</i>, the buyer is contractually obligated to do the same. <cite> <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original, extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-nl-cre-process" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="nl-cre-process"><span class="section-number-4">33.9.6.</span> Pro tip: Agree to a <i>process</i> instead?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-cre-process">
<p>
Outside of the context of <i>efforts</i>, a party seeking to prove (or disprove) the reasonableness of a transaction, contract term, decision, etc., might want to focus on <i>the process</i> by which the transaction, etc., came into being. EXAMPLE: In its 1990 <i>West Texas Transmission</i> decision, the Fifth Circuit remarked that "[w]here two sophisticated businesses reach a hard-fought agreement through lengthy negotiations, it is difficult to conclude that any negotiated term placed in their contract is commercially unreasonable." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14571229305189389501">West Texas Transmission, LP v. Enron Corp.</a>, 907 F.2d 1554, 1563 (5th Cir. 1990) (affirrming district court's refusal to grant specific performance of right of first refusal) (extensive citations omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
This suggests that, when it comes to commercially-reasonable <i>efforts</i>, if parties can't (or don't want to take the time to) specify what outcome they want, then perhaps they could agree instead to a reasonable <i>process</i> that they will use later to decide what the outcome will be, such as the escalation clause at Protocol <a href="#r-escal-ext">2.6</a>.

<div id="outline-container-nl-cre-burden" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="nl-cre-burden"><span class="section-number-4">33.9.7.</span> Whose burden is it to define the extent of efforts required?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-cre-burden">
<p>
A party that sues for breach of an efforts obligation might need to adduce specific evidence to educate the court about just what level of effort was required to meet the obligation in the particular circumstances — failing which, the court might dismiss the claim. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The SDNY explained: "When the term 'commercially reasonable efforts' is not defined by the contract, courts in this district require the party seeking to enforce the efforts provision to establish the objective standard by which the breaching party's efforts are to be judged, in the context of the particular industry." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=598465974293934143">Holland Loader Company, LLC v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-best-eff-danger">
<p>
Parties that agree to include a best-efforts obligation in a contract can get into costly disputes about whether particular actions satisfied the obligation. That's because: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  With the benefit of plenty of time and <b>20-20 hindsight</b>, litigation counsel — <b>coached by</b> a paid expert witness — will second-guess the choices that the obligated party made.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  Then it might be up to randomly-selected jurors to decide the best-efforts question — and because jurors often aren't familiar with the relevant business environment, they might end up deciding, in part, on the basis of which witnesses they liked best.

In its much-noted <i>Williams Cos.</i> decision, Delaware's supreme court held that "reasonable best efforts" required <i>all reasonable</i> steps. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1175897943756751015">Williams Cos. v. Energy Transfer Equity, L.P.,</a> 159 A.3d 264 (Del. 2017). The supreme court held that Williams Cos.'s counterparty Energy Transfer had indeed breached its obligation to make such efforts, but also that Energy Transfer had shown that its breach did not have a material effect. </cite>

<p>
<i>All reasonable efforts</i> is reportedly a common formulation in the UK and Australia as well. <cite> See generally, e.g., Menelaus Kouzoupis and Margaux Harris, <a href="https://www.shlegal.com/docs/default-source/news-insights-documents/best-endeavours-vs-reasonable-endeavours_not-two-sides-of-the-same-coin.pdf">"Best endeavours" vs "reasonable endeavours": Not two sides of the same coin</a> (SHLegal.com 2020); Shawn C.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-best-eff-enfor">
<p>
A best-efforts clause might be unenforceable if it doesn't indicate the desired object of the efforts with sufficient clarity to allow a court to assess the obligated party's performance.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In a Texas case, the buyer of a company had agreed, as part of the purchase agreement, to make <a href="#c-earn-out">earn-out payments</a> to the seller; the buyer also committed to use its best efforts to operate the acquired business "in a manner that maximizes the Earn-Out Payments &#x2026;." Affirming summary judgment in favor of the buyer, the court ruled that this best-efforts provision was unenforceable because "the contract at issue here lacks a clear set of guidelines against which <i>[the buyer's]</i> best efforts can be measured," and that what the contract <i>did</i> say on that score "is not enough to go on &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3885383475704791809">Spain v.

</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Fifth Circuit threw out a fraudulent-inducement jury verdict against a party alleged to have never intended to use its best efforts to promote sales of specified products: "Because the 'best efforts' clause is too indefinite and vague to provide a basis for enforcement, the [plaintiff's] claim for fraudulent inducement, as a matter of law, cannot rest on the alleged breach of this clause coupled with an alleged intent not to perform." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15072672150401870410">Kevin M.

</p>

<p>
<b>Counterexample:</b> A party agreed to use best efforts to file and make effective a securities registration statement "as promptly as practicable" and "in the most expeditious manner possible." The Fifth Circuit held that this was sufficiently definite to support a claim for breach of the best-efforts obligation. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11477207314313984165">Herrmann Holdings Ltd. v.

Best-efforts obligations are especially common when one party grants another party <i>exclusive</i> rights, for example exclusive distribution rights or an exclusive license under a patent, trademark, or copyright.

<h4 id="nl-best-eff-analogy"><span class="section-number-4">33.9.12.</span> Could analogies be useful to explain <i>best efforts</i>?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-best-eff-analogy">
<p>
To many business people, it might seem self-evident that when a contract uses the term <i>best efforts</i>, it calls for "something more" than mere <i>reasonable efforts</i> — otherwise, why bother even saying <i>best efforts</i>? That is to say:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Reasonable efforts</i> will cover <i>a range</i> of possibilities;</li>

<li><i>best efforts</i> refers to <i>somewhere near the top</i> of that range.</li>
</ul>

<p>
By analogy:  On major U.S. highways, the speed-limit signs often include both maximum <i>and</i> minimum speeds of (say) 70 mph and 45 mph:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let's stipulate that those two speeds establish the upper- and lower bounds of reasonableness.</li>

<li>Now, suppose hypothetically that a trucking company agreed that its driver would use her "best efforts" to drive a shipment of goods from Point A to Point B on such a highway.</li>

<li>In good weather with light traffic, driving at <i>55</i> mph — that is, 10 mph above the minimum speed but 15 mph <i>below</i> the maximum speed — might qualify as <i>reasonable</i> efforts, but likely not as <i>best</i> efforts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Or to use a sports analogy: <i>Best efforts</i> means <i>bring your "A" game</i>, not your "C" game, even though C is a passing grade in (U.S.) schools, and arguably is equivalent to reasonable efforts.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-BestEffCompar">
<p>
On the best-efforts front: So-called comparables could be used in measuring compliance with a best-efforts obligation could be whether the obligated party had done what it had done in other, similar transactions; this can be seen in a Seventh Circuit opinion:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The term "best efforts" is a familiar one in contract parlance, and its meaning is especially plain in a case such as this where the promisor has similar contracts with other promisees. In such a case "best efforts" means the efforts the promisor has employed in those parallel contracts where the adequacy of his efforts have not been questioned. If Olympia worked as hard for Racine as it did for its other, but noncomplaining, customers, then it was using its best efforts within the meaning of the contract. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10706781448067598460">Olympia Hotels Corp. v. Johnson Wax Dev. Corp.</a>, 908 F 2d 1363, 1373 (7th Cir. 1990) (Posner, J.) (reversing judgment below in part and remanding for new trial). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-BestEffortsBusContext">
<p>
<i>Asking for</i> best efforts can make business sense:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sure, there's some legal uncertainty associated with a best-efforts commitment.</li>

<li>But from a business perspective it can make good sense to ask the other side for such a commitment anyway: a party that makes a best-efforts commitment — to the extent that it later thinks about that commitment at all — will at least be aware that it might well have to make more than just routine, day-to-day, "reasonable" efforts. That alone might be worthwhile to the party asking for the commitment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the other hand: <i>Agreeing to make</i> best efforts could lead to trouble: If you commit to a best-efforts obligation, and the other side later accuses you of breaching that obligation, and you can't settle the dispute, then you're likely to have to try the case instead of being able to get rid of it on summary judgment.  That's because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As noted above: If a problem arises, then no matter what you did or didn't do, the other side's lawyers and expert witness(es), with 20-20 hindsight, will argue that there were X number of things that you supposedly <i>could</i> have done to achieve the agreed goal but didn't, and so you necessarily failed to use "best" efforts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.">Q.E.D</a>.</li>

<li>It might be difficult or impossible to get <i>summary</i> judgment that you didn't breach the best-efforts obligation, in which case you're likely to have to go to the trouble and expense of a full trial or arbitration hearing. The judge or arbitrator could well say that the question involves disputed issues of material fact — those issues would have to be resolved by witness testimony and cross-examination about such things as industry practices; the then-existing conditions; etc. According to the rules of procedure in many jurisdictions, that will require a trial and will not be able to be done in a summary proceeding. Your motion for summary judgment would then likely be denied.</li>

<li>The tribunal, after hearing the evidence, could find that <i>in fact</i> you did <i>not</i> use your best efforts. If that were to happen, you'd likely have a very hard time convincing an appeals court to overturn that finding.</li>

Contract drafters considering a best-efforts obligation should consider stating:

In <a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/2008/01/23/what-does-best-efforts-mean/">a 2008 blog posting</a>, Ken Adams seemed to insist that <i>best efforts</i> is in essence a synonym for <i>reasonable efforts</i>, and that therefore drafters should abjure the former term in favor of the latter. <cite> See Kenneth A.

</p>

<p>
To be sure, Ken does have at least some support in the case law for his position, as discussed at <a href="#best-eff-dil">13.1.2</a>. But that arguably amounts to lawyers telling clients, for no good reason: <i>No, you can't do your deal the way <b>you</b> want, because I say so</i>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-export-ctrls">
<p>
The export-controls laws in the U.S. are a bit complicated, but it’s extremely important for companies and counsel to get a handle on them. 
</p>

<p>
Here are a couple of examples of "exports" that might be surprising:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Disclosure of controlled technical data to a foreign national in the U.S. can constitute an "export" that requires either a license or a license exception.</li>

<li>Emailing controlled technical data to a U.S. citizen located in a foreign country could constitute an export of the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Want to do a few years in federal prison? Just do an "export" of technical data witout the required export license (or an applicable license exception). And even without prison time, you could be heavily fined and/or denied export privileges.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Ninth Circuit upheld an 85-month prison sentence for a Los Angeles-based <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi-chi-shih-9884bb20/">electrical engineer</a> for exporting to China, without an license, electronic devices to amplify microwave signals, <i>and</i> for evading national security controls in having the devices manufactured. The offense arose out of Shih’s collaboration with engineers in China in conducting research for a Chinese enterprise that develops military weapons. <cite> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/23-3718/23-3718-2024-10-25.html">United States v. Shih</a>, No. 23-3718 (9th Cir. 2024). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran was sentenced to 30 months in prison, and agreed to pay a $50,000 fine, after pleading guilty to conspiring to illegally export finance-related technology to Iran; according to a Department of Justice press release:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
As set forth in court papers, by providing the Government of Iran and end users in Iran with sophisticated, top-tier U.S. electronic equipment and software, the defendant and his co-conspirators enabled the Iranian banking system to operate more efficiently, effectively, and securely. In doing so, the defendant and his co-conspirators likely helped strengthen Iran’s economy and provided faster and more secure access to funds that enable the Government of Iran to further priorities including its nuclear program and terrorist agenda — exactly what the U.S. sanctions against Iran were intended to prevent. <cite> U.S. Department of Justice, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/us-citizen-sentenced-30-months-prison-conspiring-provide-electronic-equipment-and">U.S. Citizen Sentenced to 30 Months in Prison for Conspiring to Provide Electronic Equipment and Technology to the Government of Iran</a> (justice.gov Feb. 9, 2023); see also Brandon Vigliarolo, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/10/us_citizen_smuggling_iran/">American jailed for smuggling controlled tech to Iran</a> (TheRegister.com Feb. 10, 2023). </cite>

<p>
{{{RW
E}}} A 71-year old emeritus university professor was sentenced to <i>four years in prison</i> for export-controls violations. The professor had been doing research, under an Air Force contract, relating to plasma technology designed to be deployed on the wings of remotely piloted drone aircraft. Apparently, his crime was to use, as part of the project staff, two graduate students who were Iranian and Chinese nationals respectively. (It almost certainly didn’t help that the professor was found to have concealed those graduate students' involvement from the government.) <cite> Tennessee emeritus professor imprisoned for export violations: See Bloomberg.com 2012: <a href="https://goo.gl/gfvGhR">https://goo.gl/gfvGhR</a>; FBI.gov 2012: <a href="https://goo.gl/jtZR7C">https://goo.gl/jtZR7C</a>. ] 
</p>

<p>
Even without prison time, violation of export-controls regulations can lead to external oversight of a violator's business. EXAMPLE: 2021, Honeywell voluntarily reported that it had illegally provided foreign countries — including China — with engineering prints for parts used in a variety of weapon systems, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Apache helicopters, and Tomahawk missiles. Honeywell's settlement with the government imposed some specific compliance-monitoring requirements, requiring Honeywell to hire an external compliance officer. <cite> <a href="https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/sys_attachment.do?sysparm_referring_url=tear_off&view=true&sys_id=113eab0b1bb764902dc36311f54bcb42">Charging document</a>; Press release: <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-department-of-state-concludes-13-million-settlement-of-alleged-export-violations-by-honeywell-international-inc/">U.S. Department of State Concludes $13 Million Settlement of Alleged Export Violations by Honeywell International, Inc.</a> (May 3, 2021). </cite>

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Let’s talk briefly about franchisor insurance. Did you know that there is liability coverage available to franchise systems and their officers? 
</p>

<p>
Below is an example of a franchising services policy endorsement purchased by a startup. Upon review, insurers have some “outs” and may fight coverage of certain claims in the gray between covered and excluded claims; however, the insurer’s obligation to provide zors with a defense (a free litigator) to a franchisee claim is broader than coverage. Franchisor coverage up to $1M plus general liability is about $1K per month as a premium. Could be worth having in addition to on-call franchise counsel that focuses on compliance. 
</p>

<p>
Seems that the insurance industry needs to catch up with the times referencing “Uniform Franchise Offering Circular” in 2024 more than 16 years after that term has been replaced with Franchise Disclosure Document. Would an insurer deny a claim related to the “FDD” without reference to a UFOC? Probably no but the change in policy language should be made.
</p>

<p>
Hope this is helpful to someone. DMs open for questions.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-gfaith-gen-impl-cov">
<p>
It depends:
</p>

<p>
A.&nbsp; Unlike the law in many other states, <b>Texas law doesn't impose a general duty</b> of good faith and fair dealing in contractual relationships. As explained in <i>Subaru</i> (Tex. 2002), in that state, such a duty arises only in specific, limited circumstances: "A common-law duty of good faith and fair dealing does not exist in all contractual relationships. Rather, the duty arises only when a contract creates or governs a special relationship between the parties." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16602806731795093132">Subaru of America, Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
B.&nbsp; Somewhat similarly, Delaware law takes a cautious approach in applying the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; as the state's supreme court explained:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
&#x2026; <i>Under Delaware law, sophisticated parties are bound by the terms of their agreement</i>. Even if the bargain they strike ends up a bad deal for one or both parties, the court’s role is to enforce the agreement as written. &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
There are, however, instances when parties fail to foresee events not covered by their agreement or defer decisions to later. No contract, regardless of how tightly or precisely drafted it may be, can wholly account for every possible contingency.
</p>

<p>
<i>Subject to the express terms of the agreement, when gaps in an agreement lead to controversy</i>, the court has in its toolbox the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing <i>to fill in the spaces</i> between the written words. &#x2026; The implied covenant, however, is a cautious enterprise. &#x2026; <i>It cannot be invoked when the contract addresses the conduct at issue.</i> The implied covenant should not have been deployed in this case. <i>There was no gap to fill in the Agreement.</i> &#x2026; <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6587312515760085993">Glaxo Group Ltd. v. DRIT LP</a>, 248 A.3d 911, 919-20 (Del. 2021) (reversing, in part, trial-court judgment) (cleaned up, formatting revised). To similar effect, see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?Value">case=7352410918828249241 Health Solutions, Inc. v. Pharma. Research Assoc., Inc.</a>, 891 S.E.2d 100 (N.C. 2023), part IV.B.1 (affirming dismissal of breach-of-contract claim). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
C.&nbsp; <b>California's</b> implied covenant can't be used to "retrade the deal," as explained in <i>Guz</i> (Cal. 2000):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
But while the implied covenant requires mutual fairness in applying a contract's actual terms, it cannot substantively <i>alter</i> those terms.
</p>

<p>
If an employment is at will, and thus allows either party to terminate <i>for any or no reason</i>, the implied covenant cannot decree otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, although any breach of the actual terms of an employment contract also violates the implied covenant, the measure of damages for such a breach remains solely contractual.
</p>

<p>
Hence, where breach of an actual term is alleged, a separate implied covenant claim, based on the same breach, is superfluous. On the other hand, where an implied covenant claim alleges a breach of obligations beyond the agreement's actual terms, it is invalid. <cite> Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 352, 358, 8 P.3d 1089, 1110 (2000) (emphasis in original, extra paragraphing added); <i>see also id.</i>, 24 Cal. 4th at 373-77; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11511170839417744592">Derby v.

<p>
To be on the safe side, some drafters might be tempted to disclaim the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. But imagine how that could look to a judge or juror if the disclaimer were to be worded badly:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org38a2299">

</p>

<p>
Under the Federal Supply Schedule Program, the General Services Administration (GSA) acts as the contracting agent for the federal government and <b>negotiates base contracts with suppliers of commercial products and services</b>. 
</p>

<p>
These base (or schedule) contracts streamline the acquisition process for federal agencies and allow them to take advantage of the flexible and dynamic commercial market-pricing environment, so all federal customers, regardless of size or location, can <b>place orders directly with contractors and receive the same services, convenience, and pricing.</b>
</p>

<p>
The Federal Supply Schedule Program closely mirrors commercial buying practices. But, instead of evaluating prices head to head in a competitive environment, GSA assesses pricing as it relates to the offeror's commercial selling practices. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An offeror submits a completed commercial sales practices sheet along with supporting documentation that discloses commercial pricing, market participants, sell price, and terms and conditions for the offeror's "<b>most favored customer</b>" in a competitive environment.</li>

<li>Relying on this information and in accordance with the Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR), a GSA contracting officer determines whether the pricing is "fair and reasonable" not as it relates to the competitive environment but as it relates to the offerror's commercial selling practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Should the contracting officer accept the offer, the Federal Supply Schedule Program allows executive agencies to issue orders for those commercial products pursuant to the underlying GSA contract.

"Have-used" rights might be important to a party ("licensee") that is authorized to use another party's trade secret, patented invention, copyrighted work of authorship, or other asset.

EXAMPLE: In <i>Great Minds</i> (2d Cir. 2018), certain schools paid FedEx Office to make copies of materials licensed by a nonprofit organization under a Creative Commons license (referred to in the decision as a "public license") that prohibited "commercial use." The copyright holder sued FedEx, claiming that FedEx's copying was "commercial" and so was not authorized under that license. But the Second Circuit, affirming dismissal of the claim, held that the copying <i>by FedEx</i> still qualified as "noncommercial," even though FedEx had charged the schools for making the copies:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The public license does not explicitly address whether licensees may engage third parties to provide commercial services that assist the licensees in furthering their own noncommercial uses. 
</p>

<p>
We hold that a copyright holder must state in its license any limitation it might wish to impose precluding such an engagement. We decline to infer any such limitation in Great Minds' public license, and therefore AFFIRM the District Court's judgment.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-ins-clm-notif">
<p>
Insurance policies generally impose deadlines for the insured to notify the carrier (the insurance company) of a potential claim. Failure to meet those deadlines can result in loss of coverage. 
</p>

<p>
Some jurisdictions are stricter than others on that point. For example, when the policy is of the claims-made type, the "majority view" is that, if the claim was made during the policy period but after a shorter stated deadline, then the carrier must show that it was prejudiced by the insured's failure to meet the stated deadline.  As explained by the Eleventh Circuit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The majority of courts who have opined on this issue have applied the notice-prejudice rule, which establishes that when an insured provides notice within the policy period of a claims-made policy (the first type of notice), and breaches only the requirement that it also provide notice within a specified period of time (the second type of notice), coverage is not automatically lost. 
</p>

<p>
Instead, the insurer needs to show prejudice in order to bar coverage: "Most courts have applied the notice-prejudice rule to traditional claims-made policies that require notice or reporting to the insurer 'promptly' or 'as soon as practicable.'"

The 2025 <i>96th-16th St.</i> case in New York City arose from a condominium construction project in Brooklyn. An employee of a subcontractor of the general contractor was injured when a scaffold collapsed. The employee sued the project owner, among others. The owner tried to get coverage under the owner's general commercial liability ("GCL") policy. But the GCL carrier denied coverage, citing an exclusion for "Injury to Employees, Workers, or Contracted Persons of Insureds or Contracted Organizations."

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>7.3 Insurance.</b> Contractor shall procure and maintain for the duration of the contract insurance against claims for injuries to persons or damages to property which may arise from or in connection with the performance of the work hereunder and the results of that work by Contractor, his agents, representatives, employees or subcontractors. Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, the following:
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.1 Commercial General Liability.</b> Insurance Services Office Form CG 00 01 covering CGL on an “occurrence” basis, including products and completed operations, property damage, bodily injury, and personal and advertising injury with limits no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence.
</p>

<p>
If a general aggregate limit applies, either the general aggregate limit shall apply separately to this project/location (ISO CG 25 03 or 25 04) or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the required occurrence limit.
</p>

<p>
<i>[DCT note: Drafters should check to be sure that the ISO forms listed in this excerpt are the current versions.]</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.2 Commercial Automobile Liability.</b> Insurance Services Office Form Number CA 0001 covering Code 1 (any auto) or, if Contractor has no owned autos, Code 8 (hired) and 9 (non-owned), with limit no less than $1,000,000 per accident for bodily injury and property damage.  <i>[DCT note: See the note above about checking for outdated form versions.]</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.3 Workers' Compensation.</b> Insurance as required by the State of California, with Statutory Limits, and Employer’s Liability Insurance with limit of no less than $1,000,000 per accident for bodily injury or disease.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.4 Professional Liability (Errors and Omissions).</b> For consultant contracts, insurance appropriate to Consultant’s profession, with limit no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence or claim, $2,000,000 aggregate.
</p>

<p>
If Contractor maintains broader coverage and/or higher limits than the minimums shown above, City requires and shall be entitled to the broader coverage and/or the higher limits maintained by Contractor. <i>[DCT note: This could be significant in Texas cases, as discussed at <a href="#TOAIA">16.3.13.11</a> concerning the Texas Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act.]</i>
</p>

<p>
Any available insurance proceeds in excess of the specified minimum limits of insurance and coverage shall be available to City.
</p>

<p>
<i>DCT note: Consider also: &bull; <b>cyber insurance</b> &bull; <b>reps and warranties insurance</b> &bull; <b>excess- or umbrella coverage</b>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5 Other Insurance Provisions.</b> The insurance policies are to contain, or be endorsed to contain, the following provisions:
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5.1 Additional Insured Status.</b> The City, its officers, officials, employees, and volunteers are to be covered as additional insureds on the CGL policy with respect to liability arising out of work or operations performed by or on behalf of Contractor including materials, parts, or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations. 
</p>

<p>
General liability coverage can be provided in the form of an endorsement to Contractor’s insurance (at least as broad as ISO Form CG 20 10 11 85 or if not available, through the addition of both CG 20 10, CG 20 26, CG 20 33, or CG 20 38; and CG 20 37 if a later edition is used).  <i>[DCT note: See the note above about checking for outdated form versions.]</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5.2 Primary Coverage.</b> For any claims related to this contract, Contractor’s insurance coverage shall be primary coverage at least as broad as ISO CG 20 01 04 13 as respects the City, its officers, officials, employees, and volunteers.  <i>[DCT note: See the note above about checking for outdated form versions.]</i>
</p>

<p>
Any insurance or self-insurance maintained by City, its officers, officials, employees, or volunteers shall be excess of Contractor’s insurance and shall not contribute with it.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5.3 Notice of Cancellation.</b> Each insurance policy required above shall provide that coverage shall not be canceled, except with notice to City. <i>[DCT note: Folk wisdom among some attorneys is many insurance carriers generally won't commit to doing more than</i> endeavoring <i>to provide notice of cancelation.]</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5.4 Waiver of Subrogation.</b> Contractor hereby grants to City a waiver of any right to subrogation which the Workers’ Compensation insurer of said Contractor may acquire against City by virtue of the payment of any loss under such insurance.  <i>[DCT note: A waiver of subrogation means, generally, that Contractor's insurance carrier: (i) must pay for insured losses even if the losses were the City's fault; and (ii) cannot sue City to recoup the carrier's payments for such losses that were the City's fault; see <a href="#nl-subrog-cmt">28.24.7</a> for additional discussion.]</i>
</p>

<p>
Contractor agrees to obtain any endorsement that may be necessary to affect this waiver of subrogation, but this provision applies regardless of whether or not the City has received a waiver ofsubrogation endorsement from the insurer.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.3.5.5 Claims Made Policies</b> (applicable only to professional liability). The Retroactive Date must be shown, and must be before the date of the contract or the beginning of contract work. 
</p>

<p>
Insurance must be maintained and evidence of insurance must be provided for at least five (5) years after completion of the contract of work.
</p>

<p>
If coverage is canceled or nonrenewed, and not replaced with another claims-made policy form with a Retroactive Date prior to the contract effective date, Contractor must purchase “extended reporting” coverage for a minimum of five (5) years after completion of work.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.4 Self Insured Retentions.</b> Self-insured retentions must be declared to and approved by City.
</p>

<p>
City may require Contractor to purchase coverage with a lower retention or provide proof of ability to pay losses and related investigations, claim administration, and defense expenses within the retention. The policy language shall provide, or be endorsed to provide, that the self-insured retention may be satisfied by either the named insured or City.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.5 Acceptability of Insurers.</b> Insurance is to be placed with insurers with a current A.M. Best’s rating of no less than A-VI, unless otherwise acceptable to City. <i>[DCT note: See <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/a-m-best.asp">AM Best</a> (Investopedia.com).]</i> 
</p>

<p>
City will accept insurance provided by non-admitted, “surplus lines” carriers only if the carrier is authorized to do business in the State of California and is included on the List of Approved Surplus Lines Insurers (LASLI list).
</p>

<p>
All policies of insurance carried by non-admitted carriers are subject to all of the requirements for policies of insurance provided by admitted carriers described herein.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.6 Verification of Coverage.</b> Contractor shall furnish City with original certificates and amendatory endorsements or copies of the applicable policy language effecting coverage required by this clause.
</p>

<p>
All certificates and endorsements are to be received and approved by City before work commences.
</p>

<p>
However, failure to obtain the required documents prior to the work beginning shall not waive Contractor’s obligation to provide them.
</p>

<p>
City reserves the right to require complete, certified copies of all required insurance policies, including endorsements required by these specifications, at any time.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.7 Special Risks or Circumstances.</b> City reserves the right to modify these requirements, including limits, based on the nature of the risk, prior experience, insurer, coverage, or other special circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.8 Additional Insurance.</b> Contractor may obtain additional insurance not required by this Contract.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.9 Excess Insurance.</b> All policies providing excess coverage to City shall follow the form of the primary policy or policies including but not limited to all endorsements.
</p>

<p>
<b>7.10 Subcontractors.</b> Contractor shall require and verify that all subcontractors maintain insurance meeting all the requirements stated herein, and Contractor shall ensure that City is an additional insured on insurance required from subcontractors. 
</p>

<p>
For CGL coverage, subcontractors shall provide coverage with a format at least as broad as the CG 20 38 04 13 endorsement.  <i>[DCT note: See the note above about checking for outdated form versions.]</i>

<i>The following is cleaned up from an opinion by Judge James Ho in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5800647324452619284">Windermere Oaks Water Supply Corp. v. Allied World Specialty Ins. Co.</a>, 67 F.4th 672, 674-75 (5th Cir. 2023) (affirming summary judgment in favor of insured); no copyright is claimed in the opinion text.</i>
</p>

<p>
In a diversity case involving the interpretation of a contract, we apply the substantive law of the forum state. 
</p>

<p>
Under Texas law, insurance policies are interpreted in accordance with the rules of construction that apply to all contracts generally. 
</p>

<p>
The insured bears the initial burden of showing that there is coverage, while the insurer bears the burden of proving the applicability of any exclusions in the policy. 
</p>

<p>
In construing a contract, a court’s primary concern is to ascertain the intentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument. As with any other contract, the parties’ intent is governed by what they said. We look at the language of the policy because we presume parties intend what the words of their contract say.
</p>

<p>
Under Texas’s so-called "eight-corners rule," the insurer’s duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint to the policy provisions, without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations and without reference to facts otherwise known or ultimately proven.
</p>

<p>
When applying the rule, we give the allegations in the complaint a liberal interpretation.
</p>

<p>
In case of doubt as to whether or not the allegations of a complaint against the insured state a cause of action within the coverage of a liability policy sufficient to compel the insurer to defend the action, such doubt will be resolved in the insured’s favor.
</p>

<p>
Or as this court has previously summed it up: When in doubt, defend.

<h4 id="nl-subrog-cmt"><span class="section-number-4">33.24.7.</span> Subrogation - what is it?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-subrog-cmt">
<p>
<i>DCT note: In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10758647507804592258">Carter v. Pulte Home Corp.</a>, 52 Cal. App.5th 571 (2020), the court summarized the law of subrogation in that state. The description below is adapted from the court's opinion (at 578), with citations omitted.</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Subrogation is</b> the substitution of another person in place of the creditor or claimant to whose rights he or she succeeds in relation to the debt or claim.
</p>

<p>
In the case of insurance, subrogation takes the form of the right of an insurance company (the "carrier") to be put in the position of the carrier's customer (the "insured"). 
</p>

<p>
If the carrier pays its insured for a loss caused by a third party, then the <i>carrier</i> can sue the third party to recover the carrier's payment (as well as the insured's deductible).
</p>

<p>
<b>The subrogated carrier is said to "stand in the shoes" of its insured,</b> because the carrier has no greater rights than the insured, and it's subject to the same defenses that the third party could assert against the insured.
</p>

<p>
Thus, a carrier can't acquire by subrogation anything to which the insured doesn't already have rights.
</p>

<p>
Subrogation goes even farther: As now applied, the doctrine of <i>equitable</i> subrogation is broad enough to include every instance in which one person, not acting as a mere volunteer or intruder, pays a debt for which a third party is primarily liable, and which in equity and good conscience should have been taken care of by the third party.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<i>In some contracts, a waiver of subrogation might be unconscionable; see <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/subrogation-waiver-unconscionable-in-2970665">Bennett</a> (JDSupra 2024), discussing <a href="https://jud.ct.gov/Superiorcourt/MOD/DocumentPreview.aspx">American Commerce Ins. v.

<p>
DCT note: As a personal example, one evening in July 1984 my Honda Accord was T-boned at an intersection by a fast-moving pickup truck that ran the red light — and whose driver had no insurance. I wasn't hurt but my car suffered significant damage. 
</p>

<p>
My insurance carrier, USAA, paid to have my car repaired, and for a rental car. USAA then hired a sole-practitioner lawyer to sue the pickup truck's drive — who didn't file an answer and so had a default judgment entered against him. The lawyer promptly had the judgment recorded in the courthouse records; the amount of the judgment covered USAA's payments and my deductible.
</p>

<p>
Not long afterwards, the pickup truck's driver contacted the lawyer to work out a payment plan. (If I recall correctly, the driver had found that the recorded judgment was preventing him from getting credit.) The driver made monthly payments until the judgment was paid off, at which point the lawyer filed a release of the judgment.

<p>
Lawyers are (in)famous for making arguments about contract meaning that are just utter BS. And only seldom do courts ever call them on such arguments — probably because lawyers' ethical duty of zealous advocacy gets inflated into an excuse for bad behavior.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In <i>Days Inn Worldwide</i> (D.N.J. 2025), a federal court held that the term "reasonable attorney fees" in an indemnification provision was <i>not</i> indefinite, rejecting the defendant's contrary argument:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Instead, <i>[the defendants]</i> argue the entire indemnification provision must be held unenforceable due to vagueness or ambiguity because <b>"reasonable attorneys' fees" is not explicitly defined</b>, and that <b>the entire License Agreement becomes null and void</b> as a result of this undefined essential term. However, such a holding is neither supported by case law, as <b>courts routinely uphold</b> similar indemnification clauses, <b>nor do Defendants point the Court</b> to any analogous situation where the use of "reasonable attorneys' fees," without definition, rendered such a provision unenforceable, <b>much less an entire contract</b>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18247234679669500712">Days Inns Worldwide, Inc. v. 4200 Rose Hospitality LLC</a>, No. 2:22-cv-04822, slip op.

<b>Client pressure:</b> In <i>Bandera Master Fund</i> (Del. 2025), a Baker Botts partner "appeared to be caught between his law partners, who were hesitant about various essential elements of <i>[a particular legal opinion that the client wanted]</i>, and his client &#x2026;." who wanted the opinion. The court of chancery savaged the Baker Botts opinion, holding that the firm had rendered its opinion in bad faith to give a forceful client the result it wanted, awarding nearly $690 billion in damages and interest for breach of contract.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Section 6.2, titled “Duties of the Managing Members,” provides that:
</p>

<p>
The Managing Members shall be responsible for the day-
to-day management of the Company’s business and affairs
and shall devote such time and effort to the Company as
shall reasonably be required for its welfare and success.
The Managing Members shall coordinate meetings,
conference calls, and communicate as reasonably required
subject to a meeting once every other meeting [sic]. With
respect to contractual and legal matters handled by the
Managing Members, McMillan shall provide and make the
final decision on such business and legal matters.
Specifically, except as otherwise limited in this Agreement,
the Managing Members are authorized to own, hold,
manage, administer, operate, lease, sell, exchange, pledge,
encumber, transfer, purchase, grant options related to, and
otherwise deal with the Company assets in Delaware or
any other state on behalf of the Company, except as
otherwise provided in Section 6.3. In the event any
Managing Member fails to be able to perform his
responsibilities or fails to provide day-to-day management
of the Company, such Managing Member can be removed
and/or replaced by the vote of the Members subject to the
remaining Managing Member’s mutual consent . . . .53
Section 6.5, titled “Members Who Are Not a Managing Member” provides:
A Member who is not a Managing Member shall not
participate in the control of the Company’s affairs and shall
have no right or authority to act for or to bind the
Company. The Member hereby consents to the exercise by
the Managing Members of the powers conferred by this
Agreement and to the employment, when and if the same
is deemed necessary or advisable, of such brokers, agents,
accountants, attorneys, and such other advisors as the
Managing Members may determine to be appropriate for
the management of the Company business, subject to
consultation with all the Members.54
</p>

<p>
Section 6.3, titled “Limitations on Authority of Managing Members,” identifies
28 actions over which Non-Managing Members have a say. As to nine of the 28
actions, consent of 100% of the Members’ Percent Interest is required.55 As to the
remaining 19, the agreement provides that: “Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 6.2 above: (a) the consent of at least sixty-six and two thirds percent (66 2/3
%) of the Percentage Interests then held by the Members shall be required to do any
of the following: . . .”56 The list of 19 actions includes: “Amend this Agreement, except
as otherwise provided in Section 6.2.”57
</p>

<p>
Plaintiffs interpret these provisions collectively to prohibit a Non-Managing Member from participating in the control of the Company or seeking to bind the Company, including by amending the LLC Agreement and proposing agenda items.[58] 
</p>

<p>
<i>[And the court agrees: Trying to amend the LLC agreement violates the management clause!]</i>
</p>

<p>
Section 5.3 provides:
</p>

<p>
The Members shall meet no less than required under the Act and shall meet every other month to provide meaningful input and consultation on matters related to the Company. During the Member Meetings, the Members shall have the right to review the then current bank statements of the Company.[62]
</p>

<p>
The language "meaningful input and consultation" is a marked departure from words like "direction" or "control" and emphasizes the limited and advisory role that Non-Managing Members play under the parties' contractual scheme. It is also a marked departure from the specific right set out in the second sentence of Section 5.3—to review then-current bank statements. The second sentence reflects that the drafters of the LLC Agreement knew how to grant affirmative rights to Non-Managing Members, but failed to do so in the way that Defendants suggest.
</p>

<p>
* * *
</p>

<p>
Contrary to Defendants' assertion, Section 13.3 does not support their interpretation of Section 6.3(a)(19). Section 13.3 is a formalities clause that sets forth the mechanics for an amendment to the LLC Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(19)—that is, one approved by the Managing Members with the consent of 66 2/3% of the Percentage Interests. Any such amendment must be in writing and signed by at least 66 2/3% of the Members' Percent Interests for it to be valid and binding. <b>It does not confer on the Non-Managing Members the power to unilaterally propose and adopt amendments</b>. Nor does it trump Section 6.5 and the prohibition on non-Managing Members binding the Company as Defendants purported to do by amending the LLC Agreement.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Strategy #1 Consider Hypotheticals Scenarios 
</p>

<p>
Writing a list of hypothetical scenarios that would impact the operations of an LLC can allow members to solve problems before they ever occur. 
</p>

<p>
Members should consider making a list of hypothetical scenarios that could affect the LLC or its members, including situations such as death, divorce, or a member disappearing to Tahiti. 
</p>

<p>
After making a list of hypothetical scenarios, members should discuss the desired result and incorporate provisions needed to achieve that result into the operating agreement. 
</p>

<p>
Planning for every situation will always remain impossible. However, drafting an operating agreement that considers specific situations can allow members to solve problems before they arise in the future. 
</p>

<p>
Strategy #2 Consider the Tax Implications
</p>

<p>
LLCs are the most flexible legal entity available. LLCs can have (and frequently do have) tax statuses different from their legal entity status. 
</p>

<p>
Under the default tax rules, LLCs with more than one member are taxable as a partnership, and LLCs with a single member are taxable as a disregarded entity. However, LLCs can also elect to be taxable as a C corporation or an S corporation (when eligible). Therefore, operating agreements should incorporate tax-specific provisions that reflect the intended tax status and comply with applicable tax code provisions. 
</p>

<p>
Strategy #3 Consider Voting Rights 
</p>

<p>
LLCs provide tremendous flexibility with member voting. 
</p>

<p>
A common technique when structuring an LLC and writing an operating agreement is to create different classes of equity that provides different voting rights to members. 
</p>

<p>
For example, an operating agreement can include provisions that issues Class A equity and Class B equity, with members owning Class A equity having greater rights, sole voting rights, or no voting rights. 
</p>

<p>
Operating agreements can also allow classes of equity to vote only on specific matters. 
</p>

<p>
Other than major LLC decisions (merger, sale, etc.), members of an LLC are free to alter their voting rights through an operating agreement. 
</p>

<p>
Strategy #4 Consider the Exit
</p>

<p>
Every member of an LLC will have an exit. There are various types of exit events that need to be considered when drafting an operating agreement, including redemptions, dissolutions and wind-downs, and interest sales. 
</p>

<p>
Exit planning can get tricky when exit terms are not included into the operating agreement, forcing members to negotiate and resolve matters amongst themselves. 
</p>

<p>
Having defined terms in the operating agreement that provides clear terms and procedures will ensure members can exit the LLC as quickly, efficiently, and fairly as possible. 
</p>

<p>
Strategy #5 Consider Restrictive Covenants
</p>

<p>
Employment agreements frequently include restrictive covenants. However, operating agreements can impose similar restrictive covenants upon managers or members. 
</p>

<p>
For example, an operating agreement can prohibit members from soliciting employees, competing with the LLC, or disclosing confidential information. 
</p>

<p>
Although the Florida Revised Limited Liability Company Act provides some restrictions on competition, operating agreements can be drafted to include restrictive covenants that impose greater or lesser restrictions on members or managers. 
</p>

<p>
Operating agreements can also provide the LLC with specific remedies following a breach that may not otherwise be available under the law.
</p>

<p>
Strategy #6 Consider Deadlocks
</p>

<p>
Manager or member voting deadlock can render LLC operations impossible. However, operating agreements can include specific deadlock-breaking mechanisms that allow deadlocks to be decided based on procedures that were previously agreed upon by the members. 
</p>

<p>
Members are free to get creative with their deadlock provisions and can utilize any tie-breaking mechanism they can think of, such as coin flips, rounds of golf, or having a 3rd party decide the issue. 
</p>

<p>
Incorporating deadlock provisions into an operating agreement will ensure that the LLC can still function even when its members or managers cannot agree.
</p>

<p>
Strategy #7 Consider Ownership
</p>

<p>
LLC members are often individuals. However, LLC interests can also be owned by entities, trusts, other legal entities, or spouses as tenants by the entireties. 
</p>

<p>
Considering the potential advantages and disadvantages of each ownership type must be considered when drafting an operating agreement and structuring an LLC. 
</p>

<p>
Ensuring the operating agreement has the language needed to effectuate the desired ownership structure is critical to preserve flexibility and avoid potential challenges in the future.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-33-30">
<p>
In 1L Contracts class, we all learned about about the doctrine of mutual mistake, under which a court might decline to enforce a contract if <i>both parties</i> made the same mistake about an important underlying fact. 
</p>

<p>
But the mistake must be mutual; as the Eleventh Circuit explained in a 2022 decision, courts will not intervene on behalf of a party that failed to do its homework or that accepted sloppy contract language:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Drummond argues that the mutual mistake here was that the parties thought that BHP always set the quarterly benchmark price, when in fact, prior to entering the Agreement, companies other than BHP had set the quarterly benchmark price. However, this does not appear to be an issue of a mutual mistake, but rather a lack of due diligence by these sophisticated parties before entering the Agreement. &#x2026; At best, this was a <i>unilateral</i> mistake on the part of Drummond. The only apparent <i>mutual</i> mistake here was a poorly drafted contract. Therefore, Drummond’s claim for equitable reformation fails. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2461051742924040526">Southern Coal Corp. v. Drummond Coal Sales, Inc.</a>, 25 F.4th 864, 873 (11th Cir. 2022) (affirming, in relevant part, judgment that pricing-adjustment clause was unenforceable because agreed benchmark was no longer published; rejecting mutual-mistake argument). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-rcrdn-nts">
<p>
Drafters should consider whether the law might require (or simply permit) recording certain types of contract in the public records, so as to put third parties on notice. <i>EXAMPLE:</i>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <i>Membership campgrounds:</i> An Oregon statute, <a href="https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_94.953">Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 94.953</a>&#x2013;989, imposes requirements for recordation (among other things) for sales of "membership campground contracts." <cite> See <a href="https://cdm17027.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p17027coll3/id/14147/rec/1">Adelsperger v.

Rev. Stat. 94.986(1)</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  <i>Leases:</i> Various state laws allow, or require, recordation of certain leases or of a "memorandum of lease."

<p>
Many business dealings require parties to depend on information provided by other parties. For some such contract relationships, one party might want to propose that the other side keep specified records. This could be important because, for example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the saying, <i>trust, but verify</i> (discussed in the introduction to Protocol <a href="#r-audit-proto">9.1</a>), a contractual right to audit a party's books and records might be of little value if the contract doesn't also specify what kind of records are to be kept.</li>

<li>The party asking for records to be kept might be required to do so by law or by a flowdown obligation.</li>

<li>If the other party is reluctant to agree to reasonable recordkeeping requirements, it <i>could</i> be a red-flag warning that the other party is sloppy in other areas.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-rec-xactions">
<p>
Here are a couple of common examples:
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  A commercial lease might require the tenant to pay not just a base rent, but also a percentage of gross revenue, which the tenant must record and periodically report to the landlord. <cite> See generally the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_rent">Percentage rent</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  A technology license agreement might require the licensee to pay the licensor a royalty computed as a percentage of the licensee's gross- or net sales involving the licensed technology, as reported periodically by the licensee. <cite> See generally the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment">Royalty payment</a>. </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-rec-kind">
<p>
Depending on the circumstances, the Con&shy;tract could require a party to keep, for example: Sales journals; purchase-order journals; cash-receipts journals; general ledgers; and inventory records.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-rec-dur">
<p>
Parties might want to consider adapting the standard record-retention periods found in the [U.S.] Federal Acquisition Regulations; for that purpose, language could be considered along the following lines: <cite> See, e.g., <a href="http://goo.gl/8JbNAD">Contractor Records Retention</a>, 48 C.F.R. §§ 4.703(a)(1), 4.705. </cite>
</p>

<div class="alt" id="orge2b8bfa">
<p>
1.  The Rec&shy;ord&shy;keep&shy;er must cause each of the Records to be maintained for at least the period that the record would be required to be maintained under the (U.S.) Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FARs"), <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title48-vol1/pdf/CFR-2010-title48-vol1-part4-subpart4-7.pdf">Contractor Records Retention</a>, 48 C.F.R. Subpart 4.7.
</p>

<p>
2.  For clarity: This section is intended merely as a convenient shorthand reference in lieu of setting out the cited substantive record-retention terms; the parties do not intend to imply or concede that the Con&shy;tract and/or their relationship are in fact subject to the FARs.

"Reverse engineering" of a product can take the form, generally, of one or more of disassembling the product to study its design, and/or operating the product and observing its behavior, then using that information to try to figure out what's going on inside.

When oil giant Chevron acquired Hess Corporation, Chevron's competitor ExxonMobil sought to exercise a right of first refusal ("ROFR") to acquire Hess's stake in the oil and gas reservoir known as the Stabroek block, located in the Atlantic Ocean off Guyana in northern South America. An International Chamber of Commerce arbitration tribunal rejected ExxonMobil's claim, along with that of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation ("CNOOC"): The arbitration panel is thought to have ruled that under the contract's wording, the ROFR was not triggered by Chevron's acquisition of Hess. <cite> See Nadine Amr, Sophie Freelove, Louise Woods, and Honor Soames, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-stabroek-joa-arbitration-is-it-time-4901267">The Stabroek JOA Arbitration: Is It Time to Revisit JOA Change in Control Provisions?</a> (JDSupra.com). </cite>

<p>
The concept of severability addresses the question: If one part of a contract — such as some or all of an arbitration provision — is held to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, will the rest of the contract likewise be unenforceable? "Severability" means that a court or other tribunal can ditch (so to speak) the unenforceable part of the contract and proceed with dealing with the rest of the contract.
</p>

<p>
Whether to agree to severance of an invalidated provision is always an issue worth pondering, because from the perspective of a given party, the invalidated provision might be critical to the value of the entire agreement.

<p>
The Vendor's take-or-pay arrangement with Reseller might not serve the Vendor's desire to penetrate a market by making sales to actual customers. 
</p>

<p>
And even worse, consider this hypothetical: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reseller makes a deal with Vendor A for <i>exclusive</i> rights to sell Vendor A's <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/widget">widgets</a> in a particular territory, with a take-or-pay arrangement but no other obligation to "push" Vendor A's widgets.</li>

<li>Reseller approaches a competing Vendor B with an offer: <i>Hey, Vendor B: If you'll cover my take-or-pay payment obligations to Vendor A, then I won't make any effort to sell Vendor A's widgets, and instead I'll sell</i> your <i>widgets; that way, because I've got exclusivity for Vendor A's widgets, it follows that you won't have Vendor A as a competitor in the territory at all</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Depending on the economics, competing Vendor B might find such a lock-out proposal to be an attractive way of eliminating competition from Vendor A in the territory.
</p>

<p>
True, such a lock-out deal between Reseller and the competing Vendor B might create antitrust issues. But antitrust lawsuits are slow, complex, and most of all, expensive; Vendor A would likely prefer simply not to agree to an <i>exclusive</i> take-or-pay arrangement in the first place. 
</p>

<p>
A take-or-pay arrangement could create less-threatening problems for Vendor A: Suppose that competing Vendor B offered to pay Reseller and/or <i>its sales people</i> an extra bonus (often known as a "spiff") for selling Vendor B's widgets. That would give Reseller's sales people an incentive to give preferential treatment to Vendor B's widgets. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiff">Spiff</a> (Wikipedia.org).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-33-42-1">
<p>
A "meta" goal of this book is to give parties — both vendors and customers — some tools —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to help them identify prospective counterparties that might be less than reliable business partners; and</li>
<li>to signal their own reliability.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This stems from a contract lawyer's <i>primary</i> mission, which (in the author's view) is to help the client:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>not just steer clear of the various "rocks and shoals" that can disrupt — or even sink — a business deal; but</li>
<li>also advance the client's short- and long-term business goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So consider the business motivations of vendors and their customers:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On the whole, vendors strongly prefer to get repeat business from good customers who have a track record of timely payment. That's because getting <i>new</i> customers is costly and time-consuming — new customers have to be found, qualified, and convinced to buy — plus, there's always the financial risk that a <i>new</i> customer could turn out to be a  deadbeat that doesn't pay its bills.</li>

<li>Similarly, customers generally prefer to work with reliable vendors who've demonstrated that they'll "be there" for their customers. This was brought home, for example, in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown and attendant supply-chain disruptions, as well as the West Coast shipping strike threat.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We can paraphrase how a team from leading consulting firm Deloitte put it during the COVID-19 pandemic: When a company has good relationships with its providers, those providers can usefully be thought of as almost like external departments of the company itself. <cite> See Jim Kilpatrick, Jennifer Brown, Ryan Flynn, Aaron Addicoat, and Pierre Mitchell, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/operations/chief-procurement-officer-cpo-survey.html">Deloitte Global 2021 Chief Procurement Officer Survey</a> (deloitte.com). </cite>
</p>

<p>
So, when drafting a contract, lawyers for both vendors and customers can do their clients a service by keeping those long-term business goals in mind.

While this isn't strictly a contract case: Sports fans will remember how in July 2020, a few months into the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the NBA resumed its interrupted season in a quarantined "bubble" at Disney World in Florida; the teams continued playing there all the way through the playoffs — and saved the billions of dollars in TV revenue that would have been lost if the season had been canceled.

Adam Silver’s "collaborative" approach to being [NBA] commissioner really paid dividends in 2020, and the bubble should be remembered as one of the signature moments of his tenure.

Without a strong working relationship between the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association, the bubble could have popped before it got off the ground or as soon as the players came to terms with being physically trapped in Disney World.

<p>
If you haven't already, take a look at the "Hill of Proof" diagram for representations and warranties, at  <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>, reproduced here for convenience:
</p>


<p>
The noun <i>warranty</i> and the verb <i>warrant</i> can be thought of as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a statement of past, present, or future fact,</li>

<li>made by a party (the "<i>warranting party</i>"),</li>

<li>that a specified state of affairs exists, or existed, or will exist,</li>

<li>at or during a specified time — normally, the time at which the warranting party formally assents to the document containing the warranty;</li>

<li><b>where the warranting party promises</b> that <span class="underline">if</span> the warranted statement is shown to be (or have been) untrue, THEN — <b>regardless</b> whether the warranting party was or was not at fault for the untruth — 

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the warranting party will take one or more actions clearly specified in the contract — if any; or</li>

<li>if the contract <b>doesn't</b> specify such actions, <b>then</b> the warranting party will reimburse the warranty beneficiary (or -beneficiaries) for the <i>foreseeable</i>, <i>ordinary-course</i>, <i>economic</i> losses that are incurred by the warranty beneficiary as a result of the untruth of the warranted statement. <cite> This "foreseeable, ordinary-course economic losses" phrase draws on the well-known English case of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i>, discussed in the commentary to Protocol <a href="#r-conseq-dam-excl">23.5</a>. </cite></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>
Like a [BROKEN LINK: rep-defn], a warranty is a particular type of statement that, if false, can lead to liability — but the resemblance largely ends there, because a warranty has a different legal effect than a mere representation (as explained in more detail at <a href="#nl-rep-warr-gen">18.2</a>).
</p>

<p>
A warranting party's obligations under a warranty would be subject to any applicable exclusions of remedies or other limitations of liability stated in the contract (<a href="#lim-liab-risk-by-risk">23.7.8.7</a>).

<h4 id="nl-rep-warr-impl-law"><span class="section-number-4">33.43.2.</span> <i>Implied</i> warranties can arise by law</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-rep-warr-impl-law">
<p>
Under the law, a party might be deemed to have made <i>implied</i> warranties. Example: If Fred sells his car to Ginger without clearly saying otherwise, then the chances are extremely high that Fred will be deemed to have implicitly warranted to Ginger that yes, he does <i>own</i> the car (that is, he's not purporting to sell someone else's car).
</p>

<p>
At bottom, a warranty is a particular type of covenant, specifically, a <i>conditional</i> covenant. As shown at the "Hill of Proof" drawing at <a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>, a plaintiff must check fewer boxes to prove breach of warranty than to prove misrepresentation — but successful proof of breach of <i>warranty</i> typically results in fewer "rewards" in the form of remedies that can be had in court or in arbitration. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8340284022802305136">Fed. Ins. Co. v. Winter</a>, 354 S.W.3d 287, 293 (Tenn. 2011), <i>quoting</i> Black's Law Dictionary at 1725 (9th ed.2009). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-warr-no-rel-pf">
<p>
As seen on the <i>right</i> side of the Hill of Proof (<a href="#nl-reps-warr-hill">18.2.2</a>), if Fred sues Ginger for <i>breach of warranty</i>, he needn't show that he reasonably relied on Ginger's warranty — nor that Ginger acted negligently, recklessly, or deceptively — but simply that:
</p>

<p>
1.  Ginger made a warranty;
</p>

<p>
2.  a warranted fact proved untrue, and
</p>

<p>
3.  Fred suffered damages as a result.

EXAMPLE: A leading case on point is <i>CBS v. Ziff-Davis</i>, from the Court of Appeals of New York (that state's highest court), which in essence characterized a warranty as akin to an insurance policy, a contractual commitment to assume certain risks: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[A warranty is] <i>an assurance</i> by one party to a contract of the existence of a fact upon which <i>the other party may rely</i>. It is intended precisely to relieve the promisee of any duty to ascertain the fact for himself.

<p>
The Fifth Circuit explained the difference between a breach of contract and a breach of warranty (under the Texas version of article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Breach of contract and warranty claims are distinct causes of action under Texas law and provide for different remedies, and <b>Texas law forbids conflating</b> breach of <i>warranty</i> and breach of <i>contract</i>. 
</p>

<p>
A breach of <i>contract</i> claim exists when a party <i>fails to deliver</i> the goods as promised. Damages are only permitted under a breach of contract cause of action when [i] the seller has failed to deliver the goods, [ii] the buyer has rejected the goods, or [iii] the buyer has revoked his acceptance.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Texas law allows a buyer to revoke acceptance of a good if the good was accepted without knowledge of the nonconformity and `acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller's assurance.</li>

<li>If a buyer retains and uses, alters, or changes the goods, it will be found to have accepted them. &#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
[A] breach of <i>warranty</i> claim &#x2026; arises when a seller delivers <i>nonconforming</i> goods. 
</p>

<p>
The UCC recognizes that breach of contract and breach of warranty are not the same cause of action. 
</p>

<p>
The remedies for breach of contract are set forth in Texas Business and Commerce Code section 2.711, and are available to a buyer where the seller fails to make delivery. 
</p>

<p>
The remedies for breach of warranty, however, are set forth in section 2.714, and are available to a buyer who has finally accepted goods, but discovers the goods are defective in some manner. Thus, <i>the critical factor</i> in whether the buyer has a breach of <i>contract</i> or breach of <i>warranty</i> claim is whether the buyer has finally accepted the goods. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7906662300642837887">Baker Hughes Process & Pipeline v. UE Compression, L.L.C.</a>, 938 F.3d 661, 666-67 (5th Cir. 2019) (affirming summary judgment dismissing Baker Hughes's claims) (formatting revised). </cite>

<h4 id="nl-WarrCmtPipes"><span class="section-number-4">33.43.6.</span> Pro tip: Be careful just <i>what</i> you warrant</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-WarrCmtPipes">
<p>
Recall that a warranty is in effect an insurance policy against the occurrence of a future event — <i>even if the future event is someone else's fault</i>. In a British Columbia case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A supplier sold water pipes to a customer for use in a construction project designed by the customer. The pipes conformed to the customer's specifications — in other words, the supplier delivered what the customer ordered. But <i>flaws in the customer's design</i> led to problems.</li>

<li>The contract's warranty language stated that the <i>supplier</i> warranted that the pipes were "free from all defects arising at any time <i>from faulty design</i>" (emphasis added).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The trial court ruled in favor of the supplier because the design problem was the customer's fault — but the appeals court reversed, holding that the supplier was liable because of its warranty, saying: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
[24] North American was obliged to deliver pipe in accordance with the appellant’s specifications.  North American agreed to do so.  
</p>

<p>
Quite separately, it warranted and guaranteed <i>[sic]</i> that if it so supplied the pipe, it <i>[sic; the pipe]</i> would be free of defects arising from faulty design.  <i>These are separate contractual obligations</i>.  The fact that a conflict may arise in practice does not render them any the less so.  
</p>

<p>
The warranty and guarantee provisions reflect a distribution of risk. 
</p>

<p>
* * * 
</p>

<p>
[34] Clauses such as 4.4.4 distribute risk.  Sometime they appear to do so unfairly, <i>but that is a matter for the marketplace, not for the courts</i>.  
</p>

<p>
There is a danger attached to such clauses. Contractors may refuse to bid or, if they do so, may build in costly contingencies. Those who do not protect themselves from unknown potential risk may pay dearly. &#x2026; Parties to construction or supply contracts may find it in their best interests to address more practically the assumption of design risk. To fail do to so merely creates the potential for protracted and costly litigation. <cite> <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2012/2012bcca337/2012bcca337.html">Greater Vancouver Water Dist. v. North American Pipe & Steel Ltd.</a>, 2012 BCCA 337, ¶ 24, 32 (CanLII) (extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
BUT: In 2021, Texas enacted legislation for real-estate construction and repair work that — with certain exceptions — could immunize contractors from liability for damage caused by defects in designs provided by others, effectively codifying what's known as the <i>Spearin</i> doctrine. <cite> See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code ch. 59, codifying <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB219/2021">S.B.219</a>; see also the discussion of the <i>Spearin</i> doctrine by Rose Tanner and Paul Sonderegger, <a href="https://www.thompsoncoburn.com/insights/publications/item/2022-05-31/project-owners-can-effectively-combat-contractors-efforts-to-use-the-spearin-doctrine-as-a-sword-with-strategic-planning-beforehand">Project owners can effectively combat contractors’ efforts to use the Spearin Doctrine as a sword with strategic planning beforehand</a> (ThompsonCoburn.com 2022), <i>archived at</i> <a href="https://perma.cc/H8SH-YRXR">https://perma.cc/H8SH-YRXR</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
As a Texas lawyer pointed out: "Chapter 59 expressly provides that it cannot be waived. Thus, any attempt by contractors and owners to contractually agree to waive the provisions of Chapter 59 will be void." <cite> Megan Healy Schmid, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/texas-contractors-no-longer-bear-risk-4709260">Texas Contractors No Longer Bear Risk for Defects in Owner-Furnished Designs</a> (JDSupra.com Mar. 9, 2022). </cite>

<h4 id="nl-warr-benef"><span class="section-number-4">33.43.7.</span> Who can benefit from a warranty in a contract?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-warr-benef">
<p>
Generally, if a contract warranty does not clearly identify its beneficiaries, the warranty <i>should</i> benefit only the other party (or if more than one, all other <i>relevant</i> parties) to the contract.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, if a warranty <i>does</i> clearly identify its beneficiaries, then the warranty <i>should</i> normally benefit only those specific individuals and organizations so identified (absent overriding provisions of law in the jurisdiction).
</p>

<p>
The usual rules governing claims of third-party-beneficiary status would presumably apply; see generally the commentary at <a href="#r-third-ben">2.11</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> A warranting party ABC that wants to limit the potential beneficiaries should consider using language such as, "ABC warrants <i>to XYZ</i> that &#x2026;."
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> A party that wanted its own affiliates, etc., to benefit from a warranty should make that clear in the warranty language itself. Here's a hypothetical example: "ABC warrants <i>to XYZ and XYZ's Affiliates</i> that &#x2026;."

<h4 id="nl-warr-present-vs-future"><span class="section-number-4">33.43.8.</span> Warranting a <i>present</i> or <i>future</i> fact? (It might matter.)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-warr-present-vs-future">
<p>
Drafters of representations and warranties should be careful to be clear just what is being represented warranted: Is it a <i>present</i> fact, or is it a <i>future</i> fact? The distinction can be important because in many jurisdictions: 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  The "clock" for the statute of limitations will not start to tick for a warranty of <i>future performance</i> (for example, a warranty that a car will not have any mechanical problems for X years or Y miles) until the warranty failure is <i>discovered</i>;
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;  In contrast, for a warranty of <i>present fact</i> — for example, that goods <i>as delivered</i> are free from defects — the clock starts ticking <i>at delivery</i>.
</p>

<p>
For example, in its 2019 <i>Kenworth of Indianapolis</i> opinion, Indiana's supreme court noted that:
</p>

<p>
#+begin_quote
</p>

<p>
Under the UCC, a party's cause of action accrues (thus triggering the limitations period) upon delivery of goods. 
</p>

<p>
However, if a warranty explicitly guarantees the quality or performance standards of the goods for a specific future time period, the cause of action accrues when the aggrieved party discovers (or should have discovered) the breach. This is known as the future-performance exception. #+end_quot <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14165085228410759383">Kenworth of Indianapolis, Inc., v. Seventy-Seven Ltd.</a>, 134 N.E.3d 370, 374 (Ind. 2019) (extra paragraphing added). </cite>e
</p>

<p>
And in its 2015 <i>ACE Securities</i> opinion — rejecting a claim that a contract had validly extended the statutory limitation period — New York's highest court distinguished cases in which <i>future performance</i> was warranted. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=52415138628671678">ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc.</a>, 25 N.Y.3d 581, 595-96 & n.3, 36 N.E.3d 623, 15 N.Y.S.3d 716 (2015) (affirming dismissal of complaint as untimely). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-warr-consum">
<p>
Some states do not allow companies to sell consumer products "as is"; in those states, sellers have implied-warranty obligations that cannot be avoided. And the federal <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law">Magnuson-Moss Act</a> prohibits a company from disclaiming <i>implied</i> warranties (see <a href="#impl-warr-goods">18.1.6.1</a>) for any consumer product <b>if</b> the company offers a <i>written</i> warranty for the product <b>or</b> sells a service contract for it.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-nl-warr-defn-top">
<p>
Drafters should consider the following issues:
</p>

<p>
1.  What <i>exact</i> past, present, or future fact will a party "warrant"?
</p>

<p>
2.  Would the warranting party prefer to make a <i>representation</i> about the warranted fact instead of a warranty? See <a href="#RelDisclBkgd">22.34.6.7</a> for discussion.
</p>

<p>
(BUT: The party that is to benefit from the warranty will <i>always</i> prefer that the warranting party do both: Represent, <i>and</i> warrant.)
</p>

<p>
3.  Will the warranting party be warranting — 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a <i>present</i> fact (for example, when a seller warrants the condition of goods <i>as delivered</i>)?</li>

<li>a <i>future</i> fact (e.g., when a seller warrants that goods will perform in a certain way for a stated period of time)?  This can make a difference for when the statute of limitations begins to run for a claim of breach of warranty, as discussed at <a href="#nl-warr-present-vs-future">28.43.8</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
4.  What exactly does the warranting party commit to <i>do</i> if a warranted fact turns out not to be true — anything specific, such as the Three Rs? (Repair, Replace, or Refund)?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the contract is silent on that point, then the warranting party would liable in damages for any breach of the warranty.</li>
</ul>

<p>
5.  Are there any <i>time</i> limits to the warranting party's obligation? For example: Warranty issues must be reported to the warranting party within X days after delivery.
</p>

<p>
6.  Are there any <i>monetary</i> limits to the warranting party's obligation? For example: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Cap:</i> The warranting party will not be liable for more than $XXX if a warranted fact turns out to be untrue; or</li>

<li><i>Basket:</i> The warranting party will not be liable for breach of warranty until the resulting damages exceeds $XXX, (<a href="#nl-liab-basket">28.4</a>) at which point:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Deductible basket:</i> The warranting party will be liable only for damages in excess of that amount (known as a "deductible basket"); or</li>

<li><i>Tipping-</i> or <i>first-dollar basket:</i> The warranting party will be liable for <i>all</i> damages after the specified amount has been reached.</li>

Let's illustrate the subcontractor concept with a simple  example. Suppose that a would-be homeowner buys an old house (a "tear-down") in a desirable neighborhood and wants to put up a new house on the site. After obtaining architectural plans:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The owner will typically hire a prime contractor, which is commonly referred to as the general contractor, or "GC," to actually get the house built.</li>

<li>The general contractor will in turn engage various other companies such as: • a demo company to demolish the old house and clear the site; • a foundation company to pour a new foundation; • a framing company to erect the frame of the house; • a roofing company; etc.</li>

<li>Each of these other companies is referred to as a subcontractor or "sub"; the subs will normally deal only with the general contractor and not with the owner.</li>

<p>
From an article by New York attorney Bradley Pollina:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The typical arrangement on most construction projects is that the property owner or developer engages the services of a general contractor or construction manager, which in turn subcontracts the work out to the various trades pursuant to a number of subcontracts.  
</p>

<p>
Under this standard arrangement, subcontractors seeking payment for their work are generally limited to recovering funds from the general contractor or construction manager, as that is the party they contracted with.  
</p>

<p>
Generally, under such an arrangement, <b>there is no basis for an unpaid subcontractor to sue the property owner</b> or developer for nonpayment because there is no contract between them. 
</p>

<p>
(The obvious exception is a <b>mechanic’s lien</b> foreclosure action, where unpaid subcontractors, among others, can directly pursue a claim against the real property at issue, even where they do not have a contract with the owner.)

A customer that engages a contractor should keep in mind that the law might make the <i>customer</i> responsible for the contractor's or subcontractor's failure to pay employee wages. For example:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=2810.3.&lawCode=LAB">California Labor Code § 2810.3</a> makes certain <i>business</i> customers liable, as a matter of law, for unpaid wages and worker's compensation coverage of their contractors' non-exempt employees.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=2810.">California Labor Code § 2810</a> prohibits both business- and personal customers from entering into labor- or service contracts "with a construction, farm labor, garment, janitorial, security guard, or warehouse contractor, <i>where the person or entity knows <b>or should know</b> that the contract or agreement does not include funds sufficient</i> to allow the contractor to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws or regulations governing the labor or services to be provided."</li>
</ul>

<p>
Under subdivision g of section 2810, a customer that violates this prohibition is liable to any contractor employees who are injured by a violation of law or regulation. (Other subdivisions contain certain exceptions, including for residential construction work, as well as certain rebuttable presumptions if the contract documentation conforms to particular standards.)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-active">
<p>
<i>[See my note at the end of this section about its sources.]</i>
</p>

<p>
Strive to use active voice where possible. Active voice gets to the point by putting the actor first. 
</p>

<p>
Look at the following before-and-after examples:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="orgbea62c2">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     A song was sung by her. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>     She sang a song.
</p>

</div>

<p>
But <b>sometimes passive voice is better</b> — for example, if the doer or actor of the action is unknown, unimportant, obvious, or better left unnamed.
</p>

<p>
Here are more hypothetical examples:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The part is to be shipped on 1 June. (If the actor is unclear or unimportant.)</li>
<li>Presidents are elected every four years. (The actors are obvious.)</li>
<li>Christmas has been scheduled as a workday. (The actor is better left unsaid.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
And clear, forceful, active-voice language might  be <i>inappropriate</i> in diplomacy, in political negotiations, or in contract negotiations. 
</p>

<p>
(In the original, the above sentence said "… <i>may</i> be inappropriate," but it’s better to stick with "<i>might</i> be": Use "may" for permission, "might" for possibility, as discussed at  <a href="#may-might">29.2.2</a>.)
</p>

<p>
<b>But:</b> Be careful not to let sloppy passive-voice drafting become a harmful <a href="#false-imper">false imperative</a> (<a href="#false-imper">30.23</a>).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nl-aris-out-defn">
<p>
The term "arising out of <i>or relating to</i>" is usually interpreted broadly by courts. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: The Second circuit explained:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Insurance contracts ordinarily require that there be some causal link between the claimed loss and an enumerated set of covered events, and that causal link usually will come in the form of <b>either</b> a but-for <b>or</b> proximate causation requirement. 
</p>

<p>
A <b>but-for cause</b> is the cause without which the event could not have occurred. There can be multiple but-for causes. 
</p>

<p>
A <b>proximate cause</b> in the insurance context, by contrast, is "a single event or peril that directly causes a loss without which the loss would not have occurred. In other words, but-for causation sweeps more broadly than proximate causation.  <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12844700482248526966">Citgo Petroleum Corp. v. Ascot Underwriting Ltd.</a>, No. 24-0227-cv, part III.A, slip op. (2d Cir. Oct. 28, 2025) (affirming jury verdict awarding $54.2 million in damages to Citgo; insurance policy covered seizure of cargo of crude oil by Venezuelan authorities under insurrection provision in policy) (cleaned up, extra paragraphing added). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
EXAMPLE: "To say that a dispute is one 'arising from or in connection with maintenance performed by Williams' is to say that it had some causal connection to—that it originated from, grew out of, or flowed from—such maintenance. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14318267422855056360">Dodson Int'l Parts, Inc. v. Williams Int'l Co.</a>, 12 F.4th 1212, 1220-21 (10th Cir. 2021) (cleaned up; extensive citations omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: "The phrase 'arising from' requires only but-for causation (not proximate causation) &#x2026;." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5823093908634626953">Zaftr Inc. v. Kirk</a>, No. 24-2702, slip op. (E.D. Pa. Oct. 29, 2025) (granting insurance carrier's motion for summary judgment: claimed loss was clearly excluded by policy terms) (citations of Pennsylvania- and Third-Circuit case law omitted). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The term "relating to" is relatively broad (compared with the narrower "arising out of") but it's not of unlimited scope: In the context of determining the scope of an arbitration agreement, in 2017 the Ninth Circuit noted:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
And though we have recognized that the phrase 'relate to' is broader than the phrases 'arising out of' or 'arising under,' &#x2026; "related to" marks a barrier by indicating some direct relationship; otherwise the term would stretch to the horizon and have no limiting purpose &#x2026;. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4859409419094796454">United States and Nevada ex rel. Welch v. My Left Foot Childrens Therapy, LLC</a>, 871 F.3d 791, 798 (9th Cir. 2017) (cleaned up, citations omitted). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In 2023, Delaware's chancery court had this to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This Court has considered the connector "relating to" to be paradigmatically broad. Indeed, the term "relating to" is one of the far-reaching terms often used by lawyers when they wish to capture the broadest possible universe. Given its breadth, a provision that extends to matters "relating to" an agreement encompasses *any issues that touch on contract rights or contract performance." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14515735303092586419">Intrepid Investments, LLC v. London Bay Capital, LLC</a>, No. 12077, slip op. at text acc. nn.67-74. (Del Ch. Jun. 21, 2023) (cleaned up, footnotes omitted, emphasis added).

</blockquote>


<p>
Following this principle, the Delaware court held that the plaintiff's new claims for <i>fraudulent transfer</i> were barred by the <i>res judicata</i> effect of a judgment in a prior lawsuit between the parties in <i>New York's</i> courts, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The plaintiff's new fraudulent-transfer claims did not "touch on" the rights and performance of an LLC operating agreement, which included a forum-selection clause requiring litigation in <i>Delaware</i> of any claim "arising out of or relating in any way to this [Operating] Agreement."</li>

<li>The plaintiff therefore <i>could</i> have brought the fraudulent-transfer in the <i>New York</i> lawsuit, not merely in Delaware.</li>

<li>Consequently, the new fraudulent-transfer claims were barred by the <i>res judicata</i> effect of the results in the New York lawsuit.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the other hand, said the Delaware court, the plaintiff's new claims for <i>tortious interference</i> were <i>not</i> barred by <i>res judicata</i> from the New York lawsuit because the tortious-interference claims <i>did</i> "touch on" the rights and performance of the LLC operating agreement, and so the claims <i>were</i> subject to the operating agreement's forum-selection clause, and thus could not have been brought in the New York lawsuit. 
</p>

<p>
Variation: In <i>Caruso</i> (1st Cir. 2023), the court noted (in a dictum) that a third-party claim <i>might</i> "arise from" an indemnifying party's act but not be "caused" by the act. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7530458085226571031">Caruso v. Omni Hotels Mgmt. Corp.</a>, 61 F.4th 215, 223 (1st Cir. 2023) (vacating judgment below and directing entry of judgment for Omni) (dictum; observing that "'arises from' in the [contract in suit] carries materially the same meaning as 'caused by'"). </cite>

License Grant and Restrictions
</p>

<p>
Define license scope with precision. Scope? Include whether access is for internal use only, per seat, by region, etc. Match the language to your actual product delivery model
</p>

<p>
Add explicit restrictions. Common examples include prohibitions on reverse engineering, circumvention, scraping, or use for competitive benchmarking
</p>

<p>
AI Licensing, Ownership, and Legal Compliance Usage
</p>

<p>
AI-specific licensing. If AI-generated output is involved, clarify who owns it, what can be done with it, and whether it is for internal or commercial use
</p>

<p>
Disclose AI use. Laws in Utah and Tennessee, by example, may require disclosure of AI-generated content
</p>

<p>
Clarify use of customer data for AI training. State law(s), such as California's, may require transparency around datasets used for model training
</p>

<p>
Define ownership of AI inputs and outputs. Address whether customer prompts, user-generated content, or resulting outputs are owned by the customer or vendor or are shared
</p>

<p>
Limit reliance and define risks. Include disclaimers for hallucinations, bias, or errors in generative outputs, and require human oversight where necessary
</p>

<p>
Comply with evolving state usage laws. Colorado (2024) and Maryland are enacting high-risk AI regulations

<p>
The term "as between the parties" is used in various places to indicate that <i>third parties</i> are not necessarily bound by — nor favored under — what the Con&shy;tract says.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: As discussed at <a href="#recitals-binding">5.3.3</a>,  <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=622.&lawCode=EVID">California Evidence Code § 622</a> provides that (with certain exceptions), "[t]he facts recited in a written instrument are conclusively presumed to be true <i>as between the parties thereto</i>, " meaning that third parties would not be bound by the recital.

<h3 id="chklist-cmt"><span class="section-number-3">34.5.</span> Checklist benefits: <i>Everyone</i> forgets "stupid stuff"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-chklist-cmt">
<p>
Why use checklists? Because even the most-competent professional will sometimes miss things — and such a lapse, if not caught in time, could have grave consequences. This was catastrophically illustrated in a 1935 prototype test flight of the legendary B-17 "Flying Fortress" bomber: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Before takeoff, the <i>highly</i>-experienced pilots and their crew neglected to make sure that wind-gust locks had been removed from certain control surfaces such as rudders and ailerons; those locks kept the control surfaces from moving while the plane was on the ground.</li>

<li>In the resulting crash, both pilots were killed — the U.S. Army's chief of flight testing and Boeing's chief test pilot. <cite> See Atul Gawande, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist">The Checklist</a> (NewYorker.com 2007) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200614025557/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist">archive.org</a> copy). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
(People have been killed by similar errors — failure to remove wind-gust locks — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gust_lock">as recently as 2021</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Those and other bitter lessons led to aviation's emphasis on checklists as a crucial backup to fallible human memory: Pilots are trained to complete a checklist before every flight (and at other important times too).
</p>

<p>
As a U.S. Air Force officer once wrote: "The majority of the notes, warnings, and cautions <i>[in these checklists]</i> have been written in blood." <cite> Gary S. Rudman, <a href="https://www.safety.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/434426/checklist-mentality-its-a-good-thing/">Checklist mentality … it’s a good thing</a> (safety.af.mil 2012). </cite>

<p>
Texas's supreme court explained in 2022:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
A <b>covenant</b> is an agreement to act or refrain from acting in a certain way. 
</p>

<p>
A breached covenant gives rise to a cause of action for damages, 
</p>

<p>
and a <i>material</i> breach excuses the other party from performance.
</p>

<p>
It is a fundamental principle of contract law that when one party to a contract commits a <i>material</i> breach of that contract, the other party is discharged or excused from <i>further</i> performance.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, a <b>condition precedent</b> is an event that must happen or be performed before a right can accrue to enforce an obligation, and if an express condition is not satisfied, then the party whose performance is conditioned is excused from <i>any</i> obligation to perform <i>[that particular obligation]</i>. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8074215351891178149#p415">James Constr.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-cdn-notes">
<p>
Consideration is something studied by every first-year law student in the U.S. and similar jurisdictions, because in those jurisdictions a contract ordinarily requires at least some kind of "consideration" to be binding. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12136510271319504247">1464-Eight, Ltd. v. Joppich</a>, 154 S.W.3d 101 (Tex. 2004) (nonpayment of the recited nominal consideration doesn't preclude enforcement of the parties' written option agreement) (extensively reviewing case law). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE:: In reversing a summary judgment, the Fifth Circuit held that an email exchange between Wells Fargo and Occidental Petroleum was not a contract, even though a different agreement between the parties <i>was</i> a contract:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Though Wells Fargo unambiguously agreed to transfer the stock between January 6 and January 10, <i>Occidental offered nothing in exchange</i>. In other words, Wells Fargo received no benefit from the e-mail exchange; nor did Occidental suffer any detriment. Accordingly, the December 2019 e-mail chain, standing alone, did not create an enforceable contract. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13568471217286437138">Occidental Petroleum Corp. v.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-role-nav">
<p>
As a contract drafter (or reviewer), you're much like a passenger in a car, truck, or other vehicle, whose driver — your client — wants your help in:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>scoping out the <b>available routes</b> to the desired destination;</li>

<li>knowing the "<b>rules of the road</b>"; and</li>

<li>thinking about <b>"what if?" contingencies</b> such as traffic jams, engine trouble, bad weather, hijackers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To be sure: You won't necessarily plan for every conceivable contingency — <i>that's</i> how contracts tend to metastasize into the much-hated tomes of unreadable legalese.
</p>

<p>
But you have to know what's out there — and then exercise some professional judgment about how to propose a plan for the client's "journey."

Toward that end, many of this book's descriptions of business protocols are written as "Protocols."

<p>
This book started life, and continues, as assigned reading for the law-school course in contract drafting that I've taught since January 2010 — in recent years, as a simulation course.  in contract drafting — at the University of Houston Law Center.
</p>

<p>
Many of the exercises and classroom-discussion questions in our course are set in the context of an evolving relationship between two companies that are based on several of my own present- and past client representations over the years.  Students will "represent" one or the other of these (fictional) companies, namely the following:
</p>

<p>
<b>MathWhiz:</b> Our fictional client, "MathWhiz LLC," is based in Houston. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MathWhiz is headed by its founder and CEO "Mary Marvel."</li>

<li>Mary is an expert in analyzing seismic data to predict where oil or natural gas deposits might be; she "came up" in the industry working for major oil companies, then started her own company.</li>

<li>"LLC" stands for "limited liability company," which is <b>not</b> the same as a "corporation."</li>

<li>We don't know whether MathWhiz was <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/corp/businessstructure.shtml">formed</a> in Texas, as opposed to Delaware, Nevada, or some other jurisdiction.  (Note: Corporations are "incorporated" in a particular jurisdiction, while LLCs, limited partnerships, and other legal entities are generally referred to as being "formed" or "organized" — <b>be sure</b> to keep that straight.)</li>

<li>MathWhiz's business has grown; the company now employs several junior analysts, and also selectively subcontracts work to others (usually, longtime friends or colleagues of Mary's) to do specialized tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Gigunda:</b> One of MathWhiz's own clients is (the equally-fictional) "Gigunda Energy," a global oil-and-gas company headquartered in California — again, not necessarily <i>formed</i> nor <i>based</i> in California. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We don't (yet) know what kind of business organization Gigunda is; we also don't know Gigunda's actual <i>legal</i> name — that will be relevant when it comes to drafting the preamble.</li>

<li>Gigunda has a significant campus in Houston — that could be relevant if a forum-selection clause (see Protocol <a href="#r-forum-sel">23.11</a>) ends up being discussed.</li>

<li>Gigunda expects to collect seismic data, over a period of about a year, from a potential oil field in Outer Mongolia.</li>

<li>Gigunda wants to hire MathWhiz to analyze the seismic data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Assumptions:</b> We'll assume that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Both MathWhiz and Gigunda, <i>most</i> of the people are reasonable, cooperative, collegial.</li>
<li>Each party recognizes that this won't always be the case in the future.</li>
<li>Each party therefore wants to guard against <i>future</i> opportunistic&#x2011;, unscrupulous&#x2011;, or predatory behavior by the other party.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-kill-deal-cradle">
<p>
If you're a small company, a quick way to kill a deal is to insist on using <i>your</i> contract form. 
</p>

<p>
For reasons good and bad, big companies and law firms often want to use their contract forms, not yours — <b>even when those contract forms might be gravely flawed</b>. <cite> See generally Tara Chowdhury, Faith Chudkowski, and Mitu Gulati, <a href="https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4783&context=umlr#page=8">The Form Knows Best</a>, 79 U. Mia. L. Rev. 607, 618 (2025) ("The reliance on the market-standard forms reflects a broader aversion to altering familiar templates, regardless of underlying flaws or legal developments"), available at <a href="https://repository.law.miami.edu/umlr/vol79/iss4/3">https://repository.law.miami.edu/umlr/vol79/iss4/3</a>; Glenn D. West, <a href="https://repository.law.miami.edu/umlr/vol79/iss4/4/">The Form Doesn’t Know Anything: A Response to Chowdhury, Chudkowski & Gulati</a>, 79 U. Mia. L. Rev. 628, 635 (2025) ("the pressure to accept what market studies supposedly demonstrate as 'market terms' is extremely powerful"), available at <a href="https://repository.law.miami.edu/umlr/vol79/iss4/4">https://repository.law.miami.edu/umlr/vol79/iss4/4</a>. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Certainly it's important to offer to draft the contract. And if the big company <i>reeaally</i> wants to do a deal with you, then you might get away with insisting on controlling the typewriter.
</p>

<p>
But <b>bad things can happen</b>, though, if you simply fold your arms and refuse to negotiate the other side's contract paper:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Even if the big company's negotiators grudgingly agree to work from your draft contract, <b>they'll start off thinking that your company is less than cooperative</b> (which isn't great for the business relationship).</li>

<li>Then later, when you ask for a substantive concession that's important to you, they may be less willing to go along.</li>

<li>And in any case, their agreement to use your contract form, in their minds, will be a concession on their part, <b>meaning that <i>you</i> now supposedly owe <i>them</i> a concession</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For a <i>vendor</i> lawyer, there's another danger in insisting on using your own contract form: <b>Your client's sales people might blame their lack of progress on <i>you</i>.</b>  Sales folks are always having to explain to their bosses why they haven't yet closed Deal X. Your insistence on using your contract form gives them a ready-made excuse: They can tell their boss that you're holding up the deal over (what they think is) some sort of petty legal [nonsense]. Even if that's not the whole story, it's still not the kind of tale you want circulating among your client's business people — and among their in-house lawyers &#x2026;.

<p>
When getting a drafting assignment from a partner (or a senior associate, or some other supervisor), always ask whether there's <b>a recent actual contract</b> that you should use as a starting point. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Caution:</b> An existing contract will often reflect <b>prior concessions</b> that were made by one or more parties during negotiations. This means that when drafting a new contract, you should carefully review the existing contract's terms and <b>determine whether that's <i>really</i> where you want to start</b> <i>this</i> project.</li>

<h3 id="def-trms-rdg"><span class="section-number-3">34.10.</span> Defined terms: Best practices</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-def-trms-rdg">
<p>
Defined terms can be quite useful — not least because they allow drafters to change the definition for, say, "Purchase Price" to reflect a new dollar figure, without having to revise the dollar figure multiple times throughout the contract. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-def-terms" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="def-terms"><span class="section-number-4">34.10.1.</span> Defined-terms formatting</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-def-terms">
<p>
When defining a term, put the <b>term itself</b> in <b>bold-faced type</b> <i>and</i> <b>quotation marks</b> (and possibly <b>parentheses</b>) to make it stand out on the page and screen — that will help the reader who comes across the defined term and wonders, "<i>what exactly does [defined term] mean?</i>" and goes looking for the definition.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="orgfe47b82">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     This Agreement is between MathWhiz LLC ("MathWhiz") &#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>     This Agreement is between MathWhiz LLC ("<b>MathWhiz</b>") &#x2026;.
</p>

</div>

<div class="bordered" id="orgaca028a">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     The term "Affiliate" refers to &#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>     The term "<b>Affiliate</b>" refers to &#x2026;.
</p>

</div>

<p>
BUT: <b>Don't</b> bold-face <b>other</b> uses of the defined term:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org7fa84dd">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span>     <b>MathWhiz</b> is to deliver the <b>Deliverables</b> to <b>Gigunda</b> no later than the time stated in the <b>Statement of Work</b>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span>     MathWhiz is to deliver the Deliverables to Gigunda no later than the time stated in the Statement of Work.
</p>

</div>

<p>
If using a defined term before the definition occurs, consider using <b>a forward reference</b>:
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="orgcb28cfa">

<h4 id="org904eebb"><span class="section-number-4">34.10.2.</span> Some benefits of "in-line" definitions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-34-10-2">
<p>
It's often convenient to include definitions "in-line" with the substantive provisions in which they are used; see, for example, the way that "Buyer" and "Seller" are defined in <a href="#draft-preamble">5.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
When you keep definitions together with their substantive provisions in this way, it makes it easier for future drafters to copy and paste an entire contract article or section into a new contract.

<div id="outline-container-gen-def-timc" class="outline-4 olnum">
<h4 id="gen-def-timc"><span class="section-number-4">34.10.3.</span> Have a separate section for <i>general</i> definitions?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-gen-def-timc">
<p>
It's also common to use a separate “general definitions” section and to place it in one of three spots in the contract:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>right after the Background section — this is perhaps the most-common practice;</li>

<li>at the back of the contract, just before the signature blocks or as an appendix after the signature blocks: there's some evidence (albeit "N=1," i.e., one data point) that this could save parties time in negotiation;<sup><a id="fnr.DefSecTim" class="footref" href="#fn.DefSecTim" role="doc-backlink">46</a></sup> or</li>

<li>in a separate exhibit or schedule (which can be handy if using the same definitions for multiple documents in a deal).</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-34-10-4">
<p>
In some contracts you might have both "in-line" definitions <i>and</i> a separate general-definitions section. In that situation, you should seriously consider serving future readers by including, in the separate general-definitions section, appropriate cross-references (in their proper alphabetical spots) to the in-line definitions. 
</p>

<p>
That way, the general-definitions section does additional duty as a <b>master index</b> of defined terms.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-defn-terms-style">
<p>
The following are some personal style preferences that help enhance readability (in my view):
</p>

<p>
– Use the phrase <i>refers to</i> instead of <i>means</i>: The former often just sounds better in different variations.  See the following example (where bold-faced type is used to highlight differences and not to set off defined terms):
</p>

<div class="bordered" id="org7fac3d7">
<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2718</span> Confidential Information <b>means</b> information where all of the following are true ….
</p>

<p>
<span class="cbxy">&#x2713</span> "<i>Confidential Information</i>" <b>refers to</b> information where all of the following are true ….

<div id="outline-container-def-term-num" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="def-term-num"><span class="section-number-4">34.10.7.</span> Don't bother numbering <i>alphabetized</i> definitions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-def-term-num">
<p>
If you alphabetize your defined-terms section (as you should), there's no need to number the paragraphs. The purpose of numbering contract paragraphs is easy referencing, both internally and in later documents. That purpose is sufficiently served just by having the definitions in alphabetical order. 
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: Ken Adams gives an example of a real-world contract that contained so many defined terms, in alphabetically-lettered paragraphs, that the paragraphs went from (a), (b), (c), etc., <b>all the way to (cccccccccc)</b>, that is, with ten "c" letters. Just imagine trying to cite <span class="underline">that</span> in a cross-reference or a legal brief. <cite> See Ken Adams, <a href="https://www.adamsdrafting.com/deranged-definition-section-enumeration/">Deranged Definition-Section Enumeration</a> (AdamsDrafting.com 2020). </cite>

<h4 id="cap-consist"><span class="section-number-4">34.10.8.</span> Capitalization consistency is important for defined terms</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-cap-consist">
<p>
It’s a really good idea to be consistent about capitalization when drafting a contract. If you define a capitalized term but then use a similar term without capitalization, that might give rise to an ambiguity in the language — which in turn <b>might preclude a quick, inexpensive resolution of a lawsuit</b>
</p>

<p>
That kind of bad news happened in a New York case: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The defendant asserted that the plaintiff’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations and therefore should be immediately dismissed.</li>

<li>The plaintiff, however, countered that the limitation period began to run much later than the defendant had said.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The court held that <b>inconsistency of capitalization</b> of the term "substantial completion" precluded an immediate dismissal of the plaintiff's claim — and so the presumably-costly litigation would continue. <cite> See <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14653201682737170524">Clinton Ass’n for a Renewed Environment, Inc., v. Monadnock Construction, Inc.</a>, 2013 NY Slip Op 30224(U) (denying defendant’s motion to dismiss on the pleadings). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Similarly: In a particular insurance policy, the term "Additional <i>Named</i> Insured" was held to have a different meaning than "(additional) Named Insured," for purposes of determining whether the additional insured can assert a claim for loss of rental income and soft costs resulting from construction delays. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3418001499257039713">BCC Partners, LLC v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Co.</a>, 140 F.4th 465 (8th Cir. 2025) (affirming summary judgment in favor of insurance carrier). </cite>
</p>

<p>
One more example: In a UK lawsuit, a construction project experienced flooding, and the parties fought over who was potentially liable for the flooding. The case turned on whether, in the relevant contract, the term "practical completion," when uncapitalized, had the same meaning as the same term when it was capitalized. The court held that the capitalized&#x2011; and uncapitalized terms did <span class="underline">not</span> have the same meaning; as result, a sprinkler-system subcontractor was potentially liable for the flooding. <cite> See <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/TCC/2017/1289.html">GB Building Solutions Ltd. v. SFS Fire Services Ltd.</a>, (2017) EWHC 1289, discussed in Clark Sargent, Antonia Underhill and Daniel Wood, <a href="http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=612300">Ensure That Defined Terms Are Used Consistently; Ambiguity Can Be Costly</a> (Mondaq.com 2017). </cite>

<h3 id="foavd"><span class="section-number-3">34.12.</span> For the avoidance of doubt: A useful guardrail</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-foavd">
<p>
There are those who scorn the phrase "for the avoidance of doubt"; for example, Ken Adams <a href="https://www.adamsdrafting.com/for-the-avoidance-of-doubt/">proclaims</a>, "How’s this for a categorical statement: Never use <i>for the avoidance of doubt</i>." But the phrase can be a useful guardrail (see <a href="#rdblk">34.15</a>) against "creative" lawyer arguments about how a preceding term should be interpreted. The phrase is basically a thinly-polite way of warning opposing counsel, <i>don't even think about trying to argue X</i>.
</p>

<p>
Example: Protocol <a href="#r-best-efforts-defn">13.1</a> states what is required of a party that agrees to use its "best efforts" to achieve a particular goal. Then, it goes on to say, "[f]or the avoidance of doubt," that the party need <span class="underline">not</span> do specific things (e.g., make any <i>unreasonable</i> effort or harm the party's own lawful interests). EXAMPLE: The Texas supreme court <b>rendered</b> a take-nothing judgment — reversing a $100M jury verdict for punitive damages against Mercedes-Benz USA — because, the court said, the plaintiff's fraudulent-inducement claim was conclusively negated by the contract's express terms, which included some avoidance-of-doubt terms (while not using the phrase).

<p>
Contracts sometimes set out alternative prerequisites for when a particular right or obligation will kick in. When doing so, keep in mind that if you omit a possibility, it could cause problems — as happened in one Fourth Circuit decision:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The contract in suit stated that a contractor was entitled to be paid by a real-estate developer if the contractor "obtain[ed] the Approvals for the Proposed Use <i>[of specified property]</i> &#x2026;."</li>

<li>But: The contract also stated <i>when</i> the contractor would be entitled to payment: (i) if the developer sold the property or (ii) acquired a building permit — <i>but not if the developer did neither</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The district court granted partial summary judgment that the contractor was entitled to be paid on an "unjust enrichment" basis; then, after a non-jury trial, the district court set the amount of payment. 
</p>

<p>
The majority of the Fourth Circuit panel agreed and affirmed the district court's ruling — <i>but:</i> A dissenting judge argued that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <i>developer's</i> interpretation of the contract language was <i>also</i> reasonable, namely that the contractor was not entitled to be paid — under any theory — unless and until the property was either sold or developed.</li>

<li>And <i>that</i> (said the dissenting judge) meant that the contract language was ambiguous — which in turn meant that the district judge should have conducted an evidentiary hearing and made a determination of the parties' intent when they entered into the contract. The dissenting judge would have vacated the trial judge's partial summary judgment ruling and remanded for a hearing on that point. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12489183081607834172">Byron Martz v. Day Development Company, L.C.</a>, 35 F.4th 220 (4th Cir. 2022). </cite></li>
</ul>

<p>
The parties dodged a bullet here, because an evidentiary hearing on this point would have been costly: The parties' counsel would have had to sift through the emails and other documentation relating to the negotiations; take the depositions of the people who were involved in the negotiations; and (possibly) hire one or more expert witnesses to try to persuade the trial judge.

<h3 id="gs-gouge"><span class="section-number-3">34.14.</span> Gouge <i>(noun)</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-gs-gouge">
<p>
"Gouge" is a U.S. Navy term for key information, things you <i>need</i> to know to get the job done and/or stay out of trouble. The <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/define-gouge-as-that-term-is-u-_WE7yEV4QO6OLePHc6WK6Q?login-new=false&login-source=requestAccessLoginGate#0">Perplexity GPT defines the term</a> thusly:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
In the U.S. Navy, the term "gouge" refers to critical information, tips, or insider knowledge that is shared informally among personnel. It is often considered essential for understanding the nuances of Navy life and operations. The gouge can include anything from practical advice on how to handle specific tasks or situations to the unofficial but crucial details that help sailors navigate their careers more effectively.
</p>

<p>
Here are some key points about the term "gouge" in the U.S. Navy:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Inside Information: Gouge is essentially the "inside scoop" or "straight dope" that provides the necessary information one needs to succeed in various situations within the Navy.</li>

<li>Informal Channel: This information is typically passed through informal channels, often referred to as the "gouge train," where experienced personnel share their knowledge with newer members.</li>

<li>Critical Tips and Tricks: It includes critical tips and tricks that are not always found in official manuals or training materials but are vital for practical success.</li>

<li>Cultural Significance: The term is deeply embedded in Navy culture, particularly in aviation and among midshipmen at the Naval Academy, where sharing the gouge is a common practice to help peers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In summary, "gouge" in the U.S. Navy context is the valuable, often unofficial information that helps sailors and officers perform their duties more effectively and navigate the complexities of Navy life.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-rdblk">
<p>
It can be useful for a contract to explicitly rule out an argument that the other side might someday make. EXAMPLE: In 2018 the Texas supreme court <i>rendered</i> a take-nothing judgment — throwing out a jury verdict awarding $100 million in punitive damages to a Mercedes dealer against Mercedes-Benz USA — because the dealer's fraudulent-inducement claim was <i>conclusively negated by the contract's express terms</i>. The supreme court summed up its holding and rationale:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The issue here is whether Carduco’s belief that Mercedes had promised the McAllen [sales] area to it was justified in light of the parties’ written agreement. Because that agreement[:]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>approved and identified only Harlingen as Carduco’s dealership location,</li>
<li>provided that Carduco could not move, relocate, or change any dealership facilities without Mercedes’s prior written consent</li>
<li>provided that Carduco’s right to sell cars in any specific geographic area was nonexclusive, and</li>
<li><i>stated that the agreement was not intended to limit Mercedes’s right to add new dealers in the area</i>,</li>
</ul>

<p>
we conclude that the parties’ written agreement directly contradicts Carduco’s alleged belief and thereby negates its justifiable reliance as a matter of law. The court of appeals’ judgment affirming the award of actual and punitive damages is accordingly reversed and judgment rendered that Carduco take nothing. <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=993031895479493834">Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC v. Carduco, Inc.</a>, 583 S.W.3d 553, 554-55 (Tex. 2018) (emphasis, bullets, and extra paragraphing added). </cite>

A number of Lighthouse clauses are guardrail provisions — or more crudely, schmuck repellent; they're meant to dissuade aggressive counsel from trying to argue the contrary. For example:

Try very hard to avoid legalese terms such as <i>hereby</i>, <i>hereunder</i>, <i>thereunder</i>, and the like.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-parallel">
<p>
In lists, you should be able to delete any item in the list and still have the sentence make sense grammatically. Here's a very-simple example (adapted from a government plain-language manual): <cite> See <a href="https://plainlanguage.gov/resources/content-types/legal-profession/">Plain Language in the Legal Profession</a> (PlainLanguage.gov, undated). </cite>

(b)  we should dim our lights.

</div>

<p>
If you deleted (a), then grammatically, the remaining list would read: "The police officer we should dim our lights." Which makes no sense.

Here's an example in a multi-paragraph style (from a student in a past semester):

Note how <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syntax">syntactically</a> the b) subdivision doesn't fit as part of the list of "c) Earn-Out Provision" — the b) subdivision reads, in effect, "&#x2026; Purchaser shall The year 5 statement must in addition include &#x2026;"; this doesn't make sense as a sentence.

<i>[Students: Items 1-5 are fair game for testing; the remaining items are nice to know but won't be tested.]</i>
</p>

<p>
1.  The safest way to format a paragraph without corrupting the document and crashing the Word program is to format the style of the paragraph, not the individual paragraph itself. <cite> See, e.g., The Styles advantage in Word (<a href="https://goo.gl/v8Jbej">https://goo.gl/v8Jbej</a>); Item 3 in the 2013 list of tips to avoid crashing Word, by John McGhie (<a href="https://goo.gl/VxqJKs">https://goo.gl/VxqJKs</a>). NOTE: McGhie's tip no. 2 is to avoid Track Changes, but I've never had a problem with that — at least so far as I know &#x2026;. </cite>
</p>

<p>
2.  To create a heading, use Heading styles: Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.
</p>

<p>
3.  Headings can be automatically numbered by using the Bullets and Numbering feature under Format. The following apply mainly to the formatting of <i>styles</i>, but can be used with caution to format individual paragraphs:
</p>

<p>
4.  On rare occasions, to adjust the line spacing within a specific paragraph, use the menu sequence: Format | Paragraph | Indents and Spacing | Spacing (almost smack in the middle of the dialog box on a Mac).
</p>

<p>
5.  To adjust the spacing between paragraphs, use the menu sequence: Format | Paragraph | Indents and Spacing menu. <i>Don’t</i> use a blank line to separate paragraphs — adjust the spacing instead. <cite> See generally Practical Typography: Spacing Between Paragraphs (PracticalTypography.com: <a href="https://goo.gl/vNjeKF">https://goo.gl/vNjeKF</a>). </cite>
</p>

<p>
6.  To keep one paragraph on the same page with the following paragraph (which is sometimes useful), use the menu sequence Format | Paragraph | Line and Page Breaks | Keep with Next.
</p>

<p>
Here are some other tips:
</p>

<p>
7.  A table of contents can be useful in a long contract. To create a table of contents, in the References tab, use the Table of Contents dropdown box and select Custom Table of Contents.
</p>

<p>
8.  Tables can sometimes be useful in contracts. To remove the borders from a table (the way Word normally creates them), first use the menu sequence: Table | Select | Table. Then use the menu sequence: Format | Borders & Shading | Borders | None.
</p>

<p>
9.  To copy and paste a short snippet from a Web page into a Microsoft Word document without messing up the formatting of the paragraph into which you’re pasting the snippet, use the menu sequence: Edit | Paste Special | Unformatted text. (Alternatively: Edit | Paste and Match Formatting.)

<i>(Law students: This should be just a review of key points from your 1L Contracts course.)</i> 
</p>

<p>
An agreement will typically be legally binding as a contract if it meets the usual requirements, such as:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There must be a "<b>meeting of the minds</b>," generally in the form of an <b>offer</b> by one party that is <b>accepted</b> by another party.</li>

<li>"<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration">Consideration</a></b>" must exist; roughly speaking, this means that the deal must have something of value in it for each party — and the "something" can be most anything of value, including for example:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a promise to do something in the future, or</li>

<li>a promise <i>not</i> to do something that the promising party has a legal right to do; this is known as "forbearance."</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Both parties must have the <b>legal capacity</b> to enter into contracts — a child or an insane person likely would <i>not</i> have legal capacity, nor might  some unincorporated associations.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> In some circumstances, a showing of consideration might not be necessary, such as in a "<a href="https://definitions.uslegal.com/c/contract-under-seal">contract under seal"</a> under English law and in the doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estoppel">promissory estoppel</a>, both of which are beyond the scope of this essay.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> In some jurisdictions, the mere fact that a contract is in a signed writing might be sufficient consideration. EXAMPLE: The Tennessee supreme court cited a <b>state statute</b> stating that "[a]ll contracts in writing signed by the party to be bound, or the party's authorized agent and attorney, are <b>prima facie evidence of a consideration</b>," and noted that "the party claiming a lack of consideration for a validly executed contract has the burden of overcoming this presumption." The court held that an educational company's contractual promise to produce as many pharmaceutical continuing-education programs "as is feasible" constituted sufficient consideration, and thus the contract was not illusory. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16972365709115506428">Pharma Conference Education, Inc. v. State</a>, 703 S.W.3d 305, 312 (Tenn. 2024) (reversing and remanding dismissal of breach-of-contract claim), <i>citing</i> <a href="https://casetext.com/statute/tennessee-code/title-47-commercial-instruments-and-transactions/chapter-50-miscellaneous-provisions/section-47-50-103-written-contracts-prima-facie-evidence-of-consideration">Tenn.

<p>
Thousands of contract forms are available online from commercial companies that screen and curate contracts filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search-and-access">EDGAR Web site</a>. Some of these commercial sites include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/">LawInsider.com</a> (membership required)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.onecle.com/">OneCLE.com</a></li>

<p>
Other sites such as <a href="https://www.rocketlawyer.com/">RocketLawyer.com</a> and <a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/forms">LegalZoom.com</a> offer forms, but it's hard to know what their quality is, nor whether they take into account the "edge cases" that sometimes crop up in real-world situations.
</p>

<p>
If you want to search <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search-and-access">the SEC's EDGAR Web site</a> yourself, it helps to know that many if not most contracts will be labeled as Exhibit 10.something (and possibly EX-4.something) under the SEC's standard categorization. This means that the search terms "EX-10" (and/or "EX-4") can help narrow your search.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> Online contract forms are best relied on as <b>sources of ideas for issues to address</b>. The clause language isn't necessarily what you'd want to use in a contract for a client.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pro tip:</b> In some contracts you find online, the "Notices" provision might include the names and addresses of the parties' outside counsel — <b>if counsel are in name-brand firms</b>, that might give you increased confidence. <i>Example:</i> In the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312510017054/dex1020.htm">real-estate lease</a> between Stanford University (landlord) and Tesla (tenant), the counsel to be notified for Stanford was a partner at Bingham McCutchen, a large Boston-based firm (which later closed its doors when hundreds of its lawyers left to join the Morgan Lewis firm).

This book generally uses the term <i>oral</i> contract, not <i>verbal</i>, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Strictly speaking a <i>written</i> contract is also "verbal," that is to say, "of, relating to, or consisting of words." See <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/verbal"><i>Verbal</i> (adjective)</a>.</li>

<li>On the other hand, contracts made by, say, gestures, such as on an old-fashioned stock-exchange or commodities trading floor, would not be <i>verbal</i>.</li>

<li>We'll leave to experts, such as <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/category/emojis">Professor Eric Goldman</a>, the question whether an agreement expressed exclusively in "emojis," see <a href="#notice-emoji">2.8.4</a>, would qualify as a "verbal" agreement.</li>

<div id="outline-container-oral-k-enf" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="oral-k-enf"><span class="section-number-4">34.30.2.</span> When would an oral agreement be enforceable?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-oral-k-enf">
<p>
Whether an oral agreement is <i>enforceable</i> as a contract depends on the evidence that's brought before the court; enforceability basically depends on two things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The contract cannot be of a type that, by law (the Statute of Frauds), <i>must</i> be in writing (see the discussion at <a href="#stat-frauds">34.34</a>); <span class="underline">and</span></li>

<li><p>
The jury,* after hearing the witness testimony and weighing the evidence, must find that there was, <i>in fact</i>, an oral agreement — and what the terms were in that agreement. 
</p>

<p>
(<i>* Or the judge in a nonjury trial, or the arbitrator in an arbitration</i>.) 
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
The evidence could include a series of emails and/or text messages — which might not be enough to be binding in themselves as a written contract, but they can provide <i>evidentiary</i> support for a jury verdict that an <i>oral</i> contract was reached.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: In an Idaho supreme court case, a jury held that an employer had breached an oral agreement to make a severance payment to a terminated employee. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9193518641157994661">Hawes v. Western Pacific Timber LLC</a>, 477 P.3d 950, 963 (Id. 2020) (affirming judgment on jury verdict). </cite>
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE: A small Texas company fired its accounting director as part of a corporate reorganization. The fired employee sued for breach of an alleged oral promise to pay him a bonus. The fired employee testified under oath that he had been promised, by the company's vice president of operations, that he <i>would</i> get a bonus — not merely that he <i>might</i> get a bonus. <i>The company apparently didn't offer any contrary testimony.</i> The jurors believed the employee and rendered a verdict in his favor; the trial court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but an appeals court reversed and reinstated the jury verdict. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1769274100515321122">Elaazami v. Lawler Foods, Ltd.</a>, No. 14-11-00120-CV, slip op. at part III (Tex. App—Houston [14th Dist.] Feb. 7, 2012) (citing cases). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, under <i>Texas</i> law, the fired employee was also entitled to recover his attorney fees for bringing the lawsuit, under section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, discussed at <a href="#r-atty-fees-tex">23.2.5.2</a>. <cite> See Elaazami, cited above, at part V (rendering judgment that Elaazami was entitled to attorney fees and remanding for determination). </cite>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-oral-k-ng">
<p>
While oral contracts can be enforceable as discussed above, they can be dangerous — suppose that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Party A claims that Party A and Party B entered into an oral contract.</li>

<li>Party B might disagree that the parties entered into a contract at all, or might simply disagree about the <i>terms</i> of the alleged contract.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Almost by definition, much will depend on witness testimony at trial — and which witnesses the jury believes. <cite> See the examples discussed at <a href="#oral-k-enf">34.30.2</a> above. </cite>
</p>

<p>
Now recall that under standard American legal principles — including the Seventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's the exclusive province of the jury to assess witness credibility and to weigh the evidence — that is, to sort through inconsistent testimony, documents, etc., and decide which is entitled to more weight and which to less weight.</li>

<li>Then, if a <i>reasonable</i> jury <i>could</i> have reached the verdict that the <i>actual</i> jury did, then the actual jury's verdict must stand. (There are limited exceptions to that rule, none of which is important here.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
That's why many businesses strongly prefer <i>written</i> contracts.

As addressed at <a href="#r-ent-k">2.4</a>, parties will sometimes use a <i>written</i> agreement to confirm — and replace —a prior <i>oral</i> agreements.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-stat-frauds">

Many law students learn the mnemonic "MY LEGS" to help remember what types of contract are covered by the Statute of Frauds:
</p>

<p>
<b>M</b> - Marriage: Prenuptial agreements and other contracts relating to marriage must be in writing (and, in some jurisdictions, must meet other requirements, such as each spouse being represented by his- or her own legal counsel, or the prenup being notarized, as discussed at <a href="#NotarizationFlaws">4.8.8</a>).
</p>

<p>
<b>Y</b> - Year: Agreements that <i>cannot</i> be performed within one year, such as an agreement to employ someone for, say, two years (this usually excludes contracts that don't specify any duration at all). BUT: An agreement that reasonably <i>could</i> be performed within a year is likely <i>not</i> within the Statute, even if it turned out that the agreement actually did take longer than a year to perform. <cite> See the extended discussion of this topic, as analyzed under Texas law, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=120233025321846046">Chase v.

<p>
An edge case: New Hampshire's supreme court held that an alleged <i>oral</i> IP license agreement from a New Hampshire company to Nokia, granting a perpetual license and obligating Nokia to pay $23 million, was not within the one-year unenforceability category of the Statute of Frauds: "it is possible to perform within one year the obligations imposed on the licensor by a perpetual intellectual property license." <cite> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-hampshire/supreme-court/2026/2025-0140.html">Collision Comms., Inc. v.

</p>

<p>
<b>L</b> - Land: Agreements  that call for transfer of an ownership interest of land (or similar interests in land such as an easement).
</p>

<p>
<b>E</b> - Executor: Agreements in which the executor of a will agrees to use the executor's own money to pay a debt of the estate.
</p>

<p>
<b>G</b> - Goods: Agreements for the sale of goods for $500.00 or more (the exact amount might vary).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-true-correct">
<p>
You might see — and be tempted to draft — contract language such as (hypothetically): "ABC certifies that each statement in its request for expense reimbursement is <i>true and correct</i>." <cite> See, e.g., the <a href="https://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=7225770-40130-562436&type=sect&dcn=0000950157-10-000587">merger agreement</a> under which United Airlines acquired Continental Airlines, in which section 7.2(a) states in part that United was not obligated to close the acquisition unless "the representations and warranties of Continental set forth in Section 4.8(a) shall be true and correct <i>[sic]</i> on the date of this Agreement &#x2026;." ]
</p>

<p>
What does that mean, exactly? In my view, it's sloppy to talk about something being "true and correct," because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's arguably redundant — is there a difference between <i>true</i> and <i>correct</i>? If so, what <i>is</i> that difference? Maybe "true" means accurate and "correct" means that it conforms to some standard — but what's that standard? To paraphrase one of my former students: That's a conversation we don't want to have. <cite> See also the discussion of "doublets," intentional use of synonyms derived from different languages such as "indemnify and hold harmless," in the commentary at <a href="#hold-harmless">22.24</a>. </cite></li>

<li>The phrase <i>true and correct</i> sometimes won't go far enough: Let's assume that the statement: <i>Jane was in the room</i> is accurate, in that Jane was indeed in the room, but leaves a gap (see <a href="#gaps">34.13</a>) because it doesn't indicate whether or not <i>others</i> were also at the meeting.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Perhaps in an archaic sense the term <i>true</i> might be interpreted broadly to mean <i>materially complete and accurate</i>. But there seems to be little reason to take a chance that a judge would see it that way,
</p>

<p>
The phrase <i>complete and accurate</i> does the job better. Say that instead.

FACTS:  Let's assume you have an elderly, childless Uncle Ed who has no legal background.
</p>

<p>
&bull;  Uncle Ed wants to sell his used, high-end, mid-2012 Macbook Air laptop computer. (He's still sharp as a tack and wants to "move up" to a more-powerful machine to use some of the latest AI technology.)
</p>

<p>
&bull;  Uncle Ed wants to get $275 for his 2012 machine <i>(which at this writing is actually close to the going rate)</i> and to sell the computer "as is."
</p>

<p>
&bull;  After Uncle Ed mentioned on Facebook that he wants to sell his computer, one of his high-school acquaintances, "Dale," contacted him and said he wants to buy the computer.
</p>

<p>
&bull;  Uncle Ed and Dale were never close in high school; they haven't seen each other since graduation some 50 years ago.
</p>

<p>
&bull;  Uncle Ed has asked you what to do to make sure he's "protected."
</p>

<p>
QUESTION 1: Is a <i>written</i> contract <i>legally</i> necessary? <i>Practically</i> necessary? Explain your thinking.
</p>

<p>
QUESTION 2: Would your answer to #1 be any different if Dale was Uncle Ed's closest friend, going all the way back to their high-school days?
</p>

<p>
QUESTION 3: Assuming Uncle Ed does want to have something in writing, what form could that writing take? (Be creative!)
</p>

<p>
QUESTION 4: <b>On paper,</b> make a bullet-point list of the "minimal" topics that such a written agreement should include.  <i>(Part of your job is to try to think of what could go wrong, and, with your client, to decide whether it's worth trying to address those risks in your draft contract.)</i> 
</p>

<p>
<b>You'll probably think, "I don't like this,</b> because I don't know what the [something] I'm doing — and you're probably right about that. <b>But it's OK:</b> That's a feature (of the pedagogy), not a bug.

For example, here's a comment about contractions, at  <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/conversational/use-contractions">plainlanguage.gov</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
While many legal authorities say that contractions don’t belong in legal writing, Bryan Garner, a leading authority on legal writing, advocates their use as a way to make legal writing, including opinions and rules, less stuffy and more natural. Contractions make your writing more accessible to the user. 
</p>

<p>
Research shows that that they also enhance readability.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="footpara">
(Extra paragraphing added, parenthetical citation omitted.) 
</p>

<p class="footpara">
Speaking of Bryan Garner: More than a quarter-century ago, Garner said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Legal writers have developed a morbid fear of contractions. Maybe that's because they tend to counteract stuffiness&#x2013;and legal writers everywhere tend to think they should sound stuffy. That's a major psychological cause of poor writing.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the more conversational your style is, the more readable it becomes. This doesn't mean that you should become loose and slangy in your writing&#x2013;just that you should try to be relaxed and natural. And contractions contribute a lot to that effect.
</p>

<p>
Here's the test. If you would say it as a contraction, write it that way. If you wouldn't, then don't. <cite> Bryan A. Garner, <i>Securities Disclosure in Plain English</i> 22 (CCH 1999), <i>quoted in</i> Wayne Schiess,  <a href="https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/wschiess/legalwriting/2005/08/garner-on-contractions.html">Garner on contractions</a> (UTexas.edu 2005). </cite>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="footpara">
(Of course, Garner <i>could</i> have said, "If <i>you'd</i> say it as a contraction &#x2026;.")
</p>

<p class="footpara">
Ross Guberman, another legal-writing guru, <a href="https://www.legalwritingpro.com/blog/judges-speak-out/">notes that</a> fully 63% of judges surveyed either are OK with contractions in parties' briefs or simply don't care.  
</p>

<p class="footpara">
And a couple of Supreme Court justices regularly use contractions in their opinions. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1665988217310336793">Pulsifer v. United States</a> 601 U.S. 124, 144 S. Ct. 718, 729 n.5 (2024) (Kagan, J.); <i>id.</i>, 144 S.

The former CEO of software giant Computer Associates, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Kumar_(business_executive)">Sanjay Kumar</a>, served nearly ten years in federal prison for securities fraud through, among other things, backdating sales contracts (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/technology/03computer.html">NY Times</a>). Kumar was also fined $8 million and agreed to settle civil suits by surrendering nearly $800 million (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/15/business/15kumar.html">NY Times</a>). Kumar wasn't the only executive at Computer Associates (now known as just CA) to get in trouble for backdating. All of the following went to prison or home confinement: &#x2013; the CFO: seven months in prison, seven months home detention (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/business/27fraud.html">NY Times</a>); <b>the general counsel: two years in prison, and also disbarred</b> (<a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ny-supreme-court/1296351.html">court opinion</a>); the senior vice president for business development: ten months of home confinement (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/07/technology/07compute.html">NY Times</a>); the head of worldwide sales: seven years in prison (<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2006/11/14/ex-computer-associatess-sales-chief-sentence-to-seven-years/">WSJ</a>).
</p>

<p class="footpara">
All of this mess came about because the Computer Associates executives orchestrated a huge accounting fraud: On occasions when the company realized that its quarterly financial numbers were going to miss projections, it "held the books open" by <b>backdating contracts signed a few days after the close of the quarter</b>. This practice was apparently referred to internally as the "<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/26/ca_hires_interim_ceo/">35-day month</a>." According to CA, all the sales in question were legitimate and the cash had been collected; the only issue was one of the <i>timing</i> of "revenue recognition," to use the accounting term.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The company had recorded the sales on its books ("booked the sale") a few days earlier than was proper under generally-accepted accounting principles, or "GAAP."</li>

<li>But that was enough to put the sales revenue into an earlier reporting period than it should have been.</li>

<li>And that, in turn, was enough to send all those CA executives to prison. (<a href="http://www3.ca.com/Press/pressrelease.asp?CID=51468">CA press release</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p class="footpara">
Likewise, the former CFO of Media Vision Technology was <a href="https://www.law.com/almID/900005534945/">sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison</a> because his company had inflated its reported revenues, in part by backdating sales contracts. Because of the inflated revenue reports, the company's stock price went up, at least until the truth came out, which eventually drove the company into bankruptcy.

<b>Late-submitted invoices:</b> In 2006, Calgon Carbon Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange company, learned that some $1.4 million in outside-counsel invoices hadn't been properly recorded as expenses for the relevant financial periods.
</p>

<p class="footpara">
Calgon Carbon's accounting department didn't properly record the law firm invoices on the company's books because the company's general counsel, i.e., the company's chief in-house lawyer, hadn't processed the invoices. (DCT note: I'm pretty sure I read an article, which I can't find, to the effect that the general counsel had stuck the invoices in his desk drawer instead of submitting them to the accounting department as he should have done.)
</p>

<p class="footpara">
The law firm's invoices were significant in amount — and when the invoiced amounts <i>were</i> properly recorded as expenses for the relevant periods, the company had to restate its financial results <i>for three different quarterly reporting periods</i>.
</p>

<p class="footpara">
The day after Calgon Carbon announced its restated numbers, the company's share price dropped by more than 24%, on something like eight times normal trading volume.

<p class="footpara">
The Calgon Carbon general counsel apparently lost his job because of this: <i>On the same day</i> that the company announced its restatement, it also announced publicly that "the employment contract between the Company and <i>[its general counsel]</i> was terminated in connection with <i>[his]</i> leaving the employ of the Company."

<p>
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to “dollars” and “$” will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of America.

The term “made available” and words of similar import means that the relevant documents, instruments or materials were[:]

(A) posted and made available to the other party on the Intralinks due diligence data site, with respect to United, or on the Bowne due diligence data site, with respect to Continental, as applicable, maintained by either company for the purpose of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, prior to the date hereof, or

<p>
No provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in favor of, or against, any of the parties to this Agreement by reason of the extent to which any such party or its counsel participated in the drafting thereof or by reason of the extent to which any such provision is inconsistent with any prior draft of this Agreement, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any party hereto.

<p>
provided further that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the inclusion of an item in either such disclosure schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on United or Continental, as the case may be. 
</p>

<p>
This Agreement will not be interpreted or construed to require any Person to take any action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law.
</p>

<p>
References to the “other party” or “either party” will be deemed to refer to United and Merger Sub, collectively, on the one hand, and Continental, on the other hand.

<b>Willful — New York law:</b> New York's highest court looked to the doctrine of <i><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ejusdem_generis%5d">ejusdem generis</a></i> in holding that, <i>in context</i> (in connection with a carve-out to a limitation of liability), the contractual term <i>willful acts</i> referred to <i>tortious</i> conduct, not merely to mere intentional nonperformance of the contract. <cite> See, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3299232019763041877">Metropolitan Life Ins.

<b>Willful — other judicial definitions:</b> The meaning of <i>willful</i> came under review in a 1998 U.S. Supreme Court decision that arose because section 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that debts from "willful and malicious injury" are <i>not</i> dischargeable in bankruptcy. The Court held that, <i>in context</i>, the term <i>willful</i> requires a showing of intent <i>to cause injury</i>, not merely intent <i>to take the action</i> that resulted in the injury. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15318245728245347162">Kawaauhau v. Geiger</a>, 523 U.S. 57, 61-62 (1998). </cite>
</p>

<p class="footpara">
Then in 2016, in a patent-infringement case, the Court held that the term <i>willful infringement</i> refers to "[t]he sort of conduct [that] has been variously described in our cases as willful, wanton, malicious, bad-faith, deliberate, consciously wrongful, flagrant, or—indeed—characteristic of a pirate." <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10314176633122896877">Halo Elecs., Inc. v.

</p>

<p class="footpara">
BUT: In 2007, in a case under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Supreme Court held that <i>in that context</i>, the term "willful" violation encompassed <i>reckless</i> violations. <cite> See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6577818274009530021">Safeco Ins. Co. v. Burr</a>, 551 U.S. 47, 127 S. Ct. 2201, 2208-09 (2007) (reversing and remanding; "GEICO did not violate the statute, and while Safeco might have, it did not act recklessly"). </cite>

One Texas appellate court has held that "willful misconduct means deliberate mismanagement committed without regard for the consequences. * * *  [W]illful misconduct does not require a subjective intent to cause harm[.]" <cite> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8866293737041783187">Apache Corp. v.

Such override language is sometimes seen in boilerplate forms. For example, a car dealership might well ask its customers to sign a contract that explicitly states that the sales person doesn't have authority to offer a better warranty.

The customer's lawyer might not have realized that this was a win for my client: Without a Cleveland forum-selection stipulation, the customer likely wouldn't have been able to sue the client in Cleveland at all, because the courts in Cleveland likely wouldn't have had <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/personal_jurisdiction">personal jurisdiction</a> over the client.

Of course, that wouldn't have stopped the customer from filing suit anyway — which would have meant that the client would have to spend time and money in trying to get the case dismissed or transferred.

In contrast, my client <i>would</i> have been able to sue the Cleveland-based (prospective) customer in Houston, because the customer had significant operations in Houston.

Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Person in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Person is indemnified hereunder; provided, however, that Parent or its applicable Subsidiary may, at its option and expense, assume and control the defense of any Claim with one counsel for all similarly situated Indemnified Persons subject to such Claim, if such counsel is reasonably acceptable to a majority of the Indemnified Persons who may be entitled to indemnification for such Claim; provided that, if such Claim commenced after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time and relates to this Agreement, the Merger or the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company, then at the election of a majority of such Indemnified Persons, such counsel shall be the counsel of record prior to the Effective Time for such Claim; provided further that any Indemnified Person may fully participate at its own expense in the defense of such Claim through separate counsel of its own choosing; and provided further that if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel of any Indemnified Person, there is a conflict of interest between such Indemnified Person and Parent or its applicable Subsidiary, or because of Parent or its applicable Subsidiary’s failure to defend for a period of 60 days any such Claim, any such Indemnified Person shall have the right to select separate counsel of its own choosing to participate in the defense of such Claim on its behalf, and the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) of defending such Claim shall be indemnified by Parent and the Surviving Corporation to the extent otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. If Parent or its applicable Subsidiary so assumes the defense of any Claim for such Indemnified Persons pursuant to the foregoing sentence, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries will be liable to such Indemnified Persons for any defense costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Persons in the defense of such Claim (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any other losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or other expenses therefrom, including from the disposition of any such Claim, that are subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.07). Neither an Indemnified Person nor the Parent, the Surviving Corporation of any of its Subsidiaries shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification could be sought without the prior written consent of Parent, in the case of the Indemnified Persons, or the Indemnified Persons, in the case of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each Indemnified Person shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and its applicable Subsidiaries, at Parent’s sole expense, in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Person could seek indemnification hereunder.
